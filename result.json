Mohammed bin Salman has continued to consolidate power in the Kingdom since becoming Crown Prince in 2017, but continues to face scrutiny over the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi . In the past the Crown Prince has temporarily taken on the title of Vice Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques when the King has been unavailable; this would not count as ceasing to be Crown Prince. Before 1 December 2020, will Mohammed bin Salman cease to be the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia? No."

Two Chinese researchers stated in a paper in February 2020 that the virus likely originated in a lab in Wuhan, China. The lab-leak theory also had champions within conservative circles in the United States. The World Health Organization dismissed the lab-leak theory, however, and -- as reported by the New York Times -- the apparent politicization of the theory in the U. S.created a \"fake bubble of consensus\" among scientists and the media against the theory . The lab-leak theory is now receiving renewed attention. On May 14, 2021,18 scientists stated in a letter to the Journal of Science that the lab-leak theory is \"viable.\" Other scientists have recently come out as less dismissive of the lab-leak theory. And on May 27, President Biden asked the U. S.intelligence community to investigate the lab-leak theory and report back to him in 90 days. Resolution details. This question will resolve based on the consensus crowd forecast of its sister question as of closing, at 11:59 ET on October 1, 2021. The consensus crowd forecast is always shown under \"Crowd Forecast\" button. It's the mean of the 68% most-recent forecasts. The bins are up to but not including the upper boundary, meaning, for example, in the unlikely event the consensus forecast is exactly 30%, the 30%-40% bin will be correct. Foretell staff reserve the right to omit forecasts when calculating the crowd consensus if we have reason to believe they were made in bad faith. In such a case, we will communicate to forecasters that we are omitting forecasts, and the effect on the consensus forecast, as soon as we are aware of the are we asking these questions? If we will never know the ground truth for a question, we cannot score it in the conventional manner. Many questions of this form are of great interest, however. A new method for scoring unresolvable questions -- called \"reciprocal scoring\" -- treats the crowd consensus as the ground truth and scores forecasters based on how close their forecasts are to the crowd consensus.

For a similar method, see Hypermind's Drip this pair of questions, we're treating the crowd consensus on October 1, 2021 as the ground truth. This question is effectively asking two questions: what new information about the origins of COVID-19 do you expect to be available by October 1, 2021, and what impact do you expect it will have on the consensus view of the crowd. ***To suggest a change or clarification to this question, please select Request Clarification from the green gear-shaped dropdown button to the right of the question.&nbsp; [Experimental] What will be the consensus crowd forecast on October 1, 2021, on whether COVID-19 originated in a lab in Wuhan, China? 0-10%.",

Legal tender is money that courts of law are required to recognize as satisfactory payment for a monetary debt. Making such as Bitcoin, legal tender has several benefits for developing countries without sophisticated financial systems. For one, it makes their economy less vulnerable to inflation caused by the actions of other country's central banks. Bukele cited recent actions by the U. S. Federal Reserve as one of the motivations for El Salvador's new law. Second, it makes it easier to send money without having a bank account. El Salvadorans living outside the country sent $5.92 billion to friends and family in El Salvador in 2020. According to Bukele, \"a big chunk of those 6 billion dollars is lost to Third, it makes their economy more attractive to crypto entrepreneurs. There are risks, however. According to The Independent, \"Speculation within bitcoin forums and among crypto commentators on Twitter is that the US could target El Salvador with sanctions, as it represents a threat to the strength of the US dollar - the other official currency of the country. One way to potentially mitigate against this risk would be for countries that accept bitcoin as legal tender to form an economic alliance. \"Paraguay and Panama appear closest to making Bitcoin legal tender, with politicians in both countries claiming they will introduce legislation similar to El Savador's. The Independent states that \"elected officials in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Nicaragua have all spoken favourably about bitcoin, with some pledging to introduce legislation that is favourable to details. This question resolves based on popular media reporting that a country other than El Salvador has taken the legal steps necessary to make Bitcoin legal tender.

The final crowd forecast was 11% for the first half of 2021 and 14% for the second half of 2021. A variation on this question was also issued for Summer 2020. Context. The South China Sea is host to vast natural gas resources as well as a number of competing territorial claims. China has built military bases on several coral atolls and reefs in the South China Sea, and rejected an international tribunal's ruling that it has no historic rights claim to resources in certain sea areas. These bases now include sophisticated facilities meant to enable military operations in this strategic area. The U. S.conducts Freedom of Navigation Operations to demonstrate China's lack of claim to the area, which have sometimes led to tense encounters between the U. S.and Chinese navies. China's Maritime Militia and Coast Guard have also clashed with foreign fishing vessels in the area. Data and resolution details. This question resolves based on popular media sources. \"Fires upon\" assumes the discharge of a weapon with lethal intent and does not include methods such as water cannons, rubber bullets, or ramming. If a shooting is claimed or reported to be made without lethal intent, e.g., a warning shot, it does not count. If intent is not reported, is disputed, or is reasonably ambiguous, it does maritime security forces include the Coast Guard and Maritime Militia. The boundaries of the South China Sea are those established by the International Hydrographic Organization , an international standards body. The Taiwan Strait is not a part of the South China Sea. ***This question is part of a forthcoming issue campaign on the future of the DoD-Silicon Valley relationship.

            ". Due to the DeepMind team's recent achievements with Alphastar, superhuman decision-making in StarCraft 2 is now on the horizon. I envision this technology becoming a platform that can be used by Blizzard and independent modders for many applications. One example is a neural network that not only plays the game, but does so by simulating human hands, a mouse, and a keyboard in order to represent human play as faithfully as possible. But in the short term, this could also be acheived by simply constraining Alphastar to mimic the human keystroke and mouse movement data that it already has access to. Right now the AI plays the game in ways that are probably impossible for humans to reproduce, but a properly constrained AI could discover the theoretical optimal strategies and meta for humans, which the player community could then learn from. Such accurately representative simulations would also make it possible to design a more perfectly balanced version of the game, as well as reliably dictate a meta that encourages desired play styles. This could be done for the professional scene in particular, but also for all other levels of player proficiency. It could perhaps be possible to create AIs on demand that play in various predefined styles, e.g.mimic individual human players, or play at a skill level so accurately defined that it can serve as the new benchmark for player rankings and leagues. Or it could do all of these at once, eventually. It could be possible to use insights from the AI's self assessment mechanisms to design a customizeable training \"coach\" for players. Alphastar is already made to calculate a win/loss prediction, continuously updating in response to the gamestate . I'm sure players would love to see graphs of win/loss prediction for their games. Do you think that AI will be applied in these ways to SC2 in the future? Do you think this will invigorate the player community, and introduce new possibilities, to such a degree that this incentivizes Blizzard to announce new content in 2021? This question asks: In 2021, will Blizzard announce new content for StarCraft as a response to advances in AI? New content means: 1) A new game, which would be a third installment , but is not really necessary considering SC2's remaining popularity. 2) An expansion pack for StarCraft 2, which would be the third, or even StarCraft, which would be second. 3) Or a patch that is not as big as an expansion, but is unprecedented in scale and scope relative to all previous patches. This means it has to be something more than and distinct from: -new skins, -new maps, -or more balance patches, all three of which occur pretty routinely. New contents must be announced in the form of an official Blizzard press release. . For new content to count as a \"response\" to AI, the press release or marketing for the game must mention AI, neural networks, Alphastar, either as having motivated the change, or been involved in the development of the content in some way. In 2021, will Blizzard announce new content for StarCraft as a response to advances in AI? yes.",

Such accurately representative simulations would also make it possible to design a more perfectly balanced version of the game, as well as reliably dictate a meta that encourages desired play styles. This could be done for the professional scene in particular, but also for all other levels of player proficiency. It could perhaps be possible to create AIs on demand that play in various predefined styles, e.g.mimic individual human players, or play at a skill level so accurately defined that it can serve as the new benchmark for player rankings and leagues. Or it could do all of these at once, eventually. It could be possible to use insights from the AI's self assessment mechanisms to design a customizeable training \"coach\" for players. Alphastar is already made to calculate a win/loss prediction, continuously updating in response to the gamestate . I'm sure players would love to see graphs of win/loss prediction for their games. Do you think that AI will be applied in these ways to SC2 in the future? Do you think this will invigorate the player community, and introduce new possibilities, to such a degree that this incentivizes Blizzard to announce new content in 2021? This question asks: In 2021, will Blizzard announce new content for StarCraft as a response to advances in AI? New content means: 1) A new game, which would be a third installment , but is not really necessary considering SC2's remaining popularity. 2) An expansion pack for StarCraft 2, which would be the third, or even StarCraft, which would be second. 3) Or a patch that is not as big as an expansion, but is unprecedented in scale and scope relative to all previous patches. This means it has to be something more than and distinct from: -new skins, -new maps, -or more balance patches, all three of which occur pretty routinely. New contents must be announced in the form of an official Blizzard press release. . For new content to count as a \"response\" to AI, the press release or marketing for the game must mention AI, neural networks, Alphastar, either as having motivated the change, or been involved in the development of the content in some way. In 2021, will Blizzard announce new content for StarCraft as a response to advances in AI? no."

            ". Under president Trump, the US goverment has adopted a policy of maximum presure towards the government of Iran, in an effort to curb its nuclear ambitions and proxy warfare. The US has, however, stopped short of calling for regime change in Iran and has thus far avoided striking targets inside of Iran. Experts have warned, however, that the killing of QUDS leader Qassem Soleimani could lead to a pattern of mutual escalation and ultimately all-out war. Will the US armed forces launch an invasion of Iran with the intention of overthrowing the Supreme Leader of Iran in 2020? Question resolves positively if both: US air AND ground forces strike targets while inside the land border of Iran. The ground forces alone have to be in excess of 2000 troops. USSOCOM-led forces do not count. And while US troops are on Iranian soil, either: a. The US government issues an official statement* calling for Ali Khamenei to or otherwise abdicate his position as Supreme Leader of Iran b. Or subsequent to a US invasion of Iran, Khamenei ceases to hold the title of Supreme Leader for any reason c. Or the US recognizes a government other than that headed by Supreme Leader Khamenei as the legal government of Iran Credible media reports that these have happened are sufficient for resolution. Question resolves negatively if on January 1, 2021 Khamenei remains Supreme Leader of Iran and the US either failed to invade Iran or not attempted regime change Question resolves ambiguously if: Khamenei ceases to be Supreme Leader of Iran prior to a US invasion for any reason. *An official statement includes any statement by a member of the executive branch that could be reasonably construed to describe the offical policy of the US goverment. Or, a bill passed by the US congress. In the case where there is ambiguity about whether a statement represents the official policy of the US government , it does not count if it is retracted or substantially amended within 48 hours. US invades and attempts a regime change in Iran in 2020? yes.",
            ". Under president Trump, the US goverment has adopted a policy of maximum presure towards the government of Iran, in an effort to curb its nuclear ambitions and proxy warfare. The US has, however, stopped short of calling for regime change in Iran and has thus far avoided striking targets inside of Iran. Experts have warned, however, that the killing of QUDS leader Qassem Soleimani could lead to a pattern of mutual escalation and ultimately all-out war.

            ". Gene drives are phenomena in a species' population in which one version of a gene, or allele, is favored over other alleles that are otherwise equally favored by fitness. A gene drive in a particular allele shows up as a bias for the corresponding phenotype in the offspring. Consider two parents with different alleles for the same gene; if there exists a gene drive for one allele, it is highly likely that all of the parents' offspring will carry the driven gene's trait. With new advances in genetic engineering using CRISPR, it is now much easier to modify an organism's genes. This makes engineered gene drives tractable: a gene coding for the CRISPR system itself can be encoded near to the gene being \"driven,\" so that if one copy of the driven allele and one \"wild\" allele are inherited, the CRISPR system modifies the wild gene so that the driven gene plus CRISPR system is inherited. This process can spread the driven gene exponentially throughout a population, at a rate far exceeding the spread of a gene that is merely favorable for survival. Uses of this method include the potential to eliminate diseases like malaria or lyme disease that are spread by a vector, by promoting traits. Valentino Gantz et.al.have genetically altered a primary malaria vector native to India, the Anopheles stephensi mosquito, to carry and pass on anti-malaria traits. Another study published in nature biotechnology offers a more drastic approach that would render female Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes, native to Africa, completely infertile, with the intent of wiping out the species in affected ecosystems. Similar studies have investigated engineering mice to be immune to Lyme disease. With Malaria afflicting hundreds of millions of people per year, advances in gene drive research have instigated public conversations about the usefulness, feasibility, and ethics of gene drives being encouraged before testing them in wild ecosystems. In the year 2020, will no gene drive be launched to fight mosquitoes in any part of the world? For negative resolution, there must be credible reports that the drive was initiated. For the purpose of this question, the wild population can be isolated to control spreading but should aim to replicate natural reproduction etc., and cannot be a laboratory setting. In case of ambiguity we will adopt as our resolution the resolution chosen by Dylan Matthews and/or Kelsey Piper in their review of their 2020 predictions. In case negative resolution is triggered, this question retroactively closes two days prior to the day resolution is triggered, but resolves on January 1st, 2021. In the year 2020, will no gene drive be launched to fight mosquitoes in any part of the world? yes.",

As a result, many wildfires are somewhat of a common occurence in California. According to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, the most destructive wildfire was the Camp Fire of November 2018, which spanned 153,336 acres, destroyed an estimated 18,804 structures and killed 85 people. According to Vox's Umair Irfan, The overall trend in California is troubling too. Six of California's 10 most destructive wildfires on record have hit in just the past three years. Similarly, According to Vox's Kelsey Piper: On a list of the ten most destructive wildfires since records started being kept in 1932, , five happened in the last decade.

            ". California has dry, windy, and often hot weather conditions from spring through late autumn that can produce moderate to devastating wildfires. As a result, many wildfires are somewhat of a common occurence in California. According to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, the most destructive wildfire was the Camp Fire of November 2018, which spanned 153,336 acres, destroyed an estimated 18,804 structures and killed 85 people. According to Vox's Umair Irfan, The overall trend in California is troubling too. Six of California's 10 most destructive wildfires on record have hit in just the past three years. Similarly, According to Vox's Kelsey Piper: On a list of the ten most destructive wildfires since records started being kept in 1932, , five happened in the last decade. That suggests that the \"new normal\" is a record fire about every other year \u2014 though 2020 is likely to be worse than the early parts of the decade, as the effects of climate change worsen.

            ". Whole Woman's Health v. Hellersted, is a United States Supreme Court case decided on June 27, 2016. The Court ruled 5\u20133 that Texas cannot place restrictions on the delivery of abortion services that create an undue burden for women seeking an abortion. The landmark case ensures states must show proof of an actual health benefit when enacting or passing abortion laws. In December, Texas Attor\u00adney General Ken Paxton called on the U. S. Supreme Court to dismiss the legal challenge to a Louisiana law that requires abortion providers to obtain hospital admitting privileges within 30 miles of the clinic, and thereby essentially toss out the Whole Woman's Health ruling. According Vox's Dylan Matthews: This term, the Supreme Court will hear and rule in the case of June Medical Services LLC v. Gee, a challenge to a Louisiana law requiring abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. As my colleagues Anna North and Ian Millhiser explain, abortion rights advocates consider this restriction both medically unnecessary and designed to shut down abortion clinics. But more importantly, the Supreme Court already struck down a nearly identical Texas law in 2016's Whole Women's Health v. Hellerstedt. The fact that it's hearing this case so soon after setting a precedent that admitting privileges laws are suggests strongly that the Court \u2014 which has since added Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh and lost abortion rights supporter Anthony Kennedy \u2014 is ready to overrule Whole Women's Health and allow more state restrictions on abortion. I think there's a real, maybe 20-30 percent chance that the anti-abortion rights majority on the court overrules Roe v. Wade outright, pulling off the Band-aid and eliminating the constitutional right to abortion in one fell swoop, as many GOP politicians have urged them to do with this case. But whether or not Roe falls, I think it's a near-certainty that Whole Women's Health will fall. Will Whole Woman's Health be overturned in 2020? This question resolves positively if Vox, the NYT, WaPo, Reuters, Politico, or the Associated Press reports that the Whole Woman's Health v. Hellersted is effectively overturned before the end of 2020. Will Whole Woman's Health be overturned in 2020? yes.",

For the purposes of this question, the launch will be considered a success if ARCA reports that the rocket reached an altitude of at least 1000 meters . Will ARCA successfully launch an rocket by June 1st, 2020? no."

            ". A very interesting analysis by OpenAI shows a dramatic and steady increase in the amount of computation performed to train the most sophisticated AI/ML systems, with a doubling time of 3.5 months rather than the 18 months of Moore's law. As of question writing, the highest amount of total computation is attributed to AlphaGoZero, at about 2\u00d7 10 23 FLOP. This is within a factor of 3 of Avogadro's number, indicating that the amount of computation going into ML systems is starting to become \"Macroscopic\" in terms of having numbers of elements comparable to the number of elementary particles in macroscopic systems. When will this be achieved? We'll ask: By end of 2020, will a published paper or pre-print describe an AI/ML system that has been trained using a number of computations that the method used by OpenAI in the above study would attribute more than 6\u00d7 10 23 operations? Resolution will be by credible estimate of a computations done in a calculation reported on in writing with enough detail to allow a calculation within ~20% of the FLOP. By end of 2020, will a published paper or pre-print describe an AI/ML system that has been trained using a number of computations that the method used by OpenAI in the above study would attribute more than operations? yes.",

That said, Hubei is far from the most populous or most densely populated province in China, let alone the rest of the world. Another larger population could overtake Hubei as the location with the largest infected population. Will another location overtake Hubei as the location of the largest COVID-19 outbreak before 2021? This question resolves positively if, at any time in 2020, a credible information source indicates that the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in any sub-national political unit exceeds that of China's Hubei province. The information sources for this outbreak are still fluid at the time of writing. Some possibilities include the WHO COVID-19 Dashboard, the JHU CSSE 2019-COVID-19 dashboard, and the relevant WHO Situation Reports. Other sources may be assessed at the Metaculus' admins judgement. The location need not necessarily be Chinese, or a province. If, for example, a large outbreak is reported in a specific city , that city may be the location which triggers the positive resolution. This question resolves negatively if after midnight on 2021-01-01, no credible information source has reported a greater number of confirmed infections in any subnational political unit than the number reported in China's Hubei province.

            ". Former Mayor of New York City and current Democratic candidate Michael Bloomberg has mounted a campaign with no precedent in US history. For one thing, he has refused to accept contributions and is instead self-funding his campaign; since entering the race in December last year, he has outspent all the other candidates combined. Because he has received no external funding, Bloomberg was also automatically disqualified from participating in all of the primary debates. In addition, Bloomberg has chosen not to compete in any of the first four states, regarded by many as critical for building momentum. His strategy is instead to focus on \"Super Tuesday\", the day\u2014March 3rd\u2014when the greatest number of U. S.states hold primary elections and caucuses, and when more delegates are at stake than on any other day during the primaries. Bloomberg's popularity has surged in recent polls; as of February 7th, he is polling at 11% nationally, according to poll aggregator. Pete Buttigieg, who won the most delegates in Iowa and has also seen a slight increase in popularity after this victory, is still only polling at 8%; while Joe Biden, the frontrunner until recently, had a singularly disappointing election, which may be repeated in New Hampshire, and generally appears to be running out of steam. These three Buttigieg and Bloomberg\u2014may be considered the only moderate Democrats running with a realistic chance of winning the nomination. After Super Tuesday, one of them will likely emerge as the leading alternative to democratic socialist Bernie Sanders. A natural test of whether Bloomberg's strategy has succeeded is whether he comes to occupy this position. So we ask: Will Michael Bloomberg win more delegates than Biden and Buttigieg on Super Tuesday? Resolution The question resolves positively if Michael Bloomberg obtains more total delegates in the elections held on March 3, 2020 than are won by Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg individually. The question resolves negatively otherwise. Failure by a candidate to run in one or more of these elections will be treated as if the candidate had won no delegates in those elections. The elections scheduled to occur on that day are those in Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, and Virginia. Resolution is according to official records. Will Michael Bloomberg emerge as the leading moderate candidate after Super Tuesday? yes.",

To compare, we will score each set of predictions using a Brier score averaged over all N=14 races, computed as S= 1 N \u2211 i=1,N \u2211 j=1, M i 2 , where j enumerates the M i possible outcomes in the ith race out of N, where p ij is the forecast probability of candidate j winning the ith race, and o ij is assigned 1 if candidate j wins the ith race, and 0 otherwise.

The proposition in question will be taken as: A major prediction market such as PredictIt, Betfair, or one of comparable liquidity has had 2020 Presidential election results materially changed using bets made with funds tied directly to Bloomberg or his campaign. That's not terribly precise, by design. It does not address the source of knowledge or fix many of the details. But this question is a bit experimental, one of a series of ones. Resolution to this question will be determined as follows: If at any time after the date of 2020-12-01 the community prediction is > 95% or < 5%, the question resolves positively or negatively, respectively. Otherwise, on or about the close and resolve date of 2022-01-01, the question will be decided by unanimous vote of a council of three people as to whether the proposition listed above is true, resolving ambiguous in the case of disagreement.

            ". On 2020-02-19, the North Korean envoy to the UN claimed that North Korea has experienced no cases of COVID-19, the novel Coronavirus which appears to have emerged from Wuhan province in China late in 2019. The North Korean Government has, however, enacted a strict policy of quarantining persons entering the country found to be exhibiting signs of a fever. The World Health Organization has also indicated that they do not have any evidence of an outbreak of COVID-19 in North Korea, though South Korean media has claimed that such an outbreak is indeed occurring, and news of it being repressed by the North Korean Government. Regardless of whether the possible pandemic has reached North Korea already, such quarantines are of indeterminate effectiveness. A growing body of evidence suggests that COVID-19 may be transmissible by asymptomatic carriers, rendering symptom-based quaratine measures effectively useless. Thus, there are two questions of relevance to North Korea: first has or will COVID-19 reach its population in spite of the quarantine measures, and second, will the North Korean government affirm the breach? Alternately, will the WHO confirm a North Korean outbreak, regardless of whether the North Korean government announces it? Stated more succinctly, Will the WHO or North Korean Government confirm any COVID-19 cases in North Korea by 2020-05-17? This question resolves negatively if on 2020-05-17, no public announcements or press releases by either the WHO or North Korean government have been issued affirming that any cases of COVID-19 have been discovered in North Korea. This question retoactively resolves positively one hour before any such announcement is made or press release issued.

            ". The COVID-19 outbreak in China has been rife with allegations of by Chinese government officials. These began at the local level, where officials in Hubei province potentially under-reported the magnitude of the outbreak in early January to Chinese central government authorities. A public health worker famously released a video around January 26 claiming that at that time, at least 90,000 cases had occurred--at the time the Chinese government was reporting fewer than 2000 infections. Since then, the strategy of counting only persons with cases of COVID-19 depressed the counts of probable cases. And the patterns of growth in the official counts follow an unexpected distribution, implying the counts may be generated by a model which doesn't accurately represent the dynamics of the disease's spread through the population. This latter allegation is perhaps the most important and severe, as it means that estimations of epidemiological characteristics based on Chinese data may lead to public health interventions which do not reflect the reality of the viral spread. For example, if the R_0 is underestimated, it may lead to insufficiently aggressive strategies for reducing the propagation of the virus across the globe. However, overestimating it could lead to quarantining strategies, hobbling international commerce. Getting a proper assessment of the epidemiological dynamics is critical to devising the appropriate public health response. Question: Will at least two public health agencies publicly accuse the Chinese government of deliberately misrepresenting the number of COVID-19 infections before 2020-05-17? Resolution This questions resolves positively if, before 2020-05-17, at least two of the public health agencies listed below claim that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately lied about, fabricated, or misrepresented case or death numbers.

This question asks whether the 1st place winner will pass 0.8 or less top-3 error rate as defined in the Kaggle competition evaluation? The question will resolve positive if the threshold is passed, negative otherwise. To achieve this threshold, an AI will need to answer correctly after 3 tries in only 20% of tasks.

One of the most severe incidents in recent history was the 1992 Los Angeles riots, during which more than 60 people were killed, more than 2,350 people were injured, and more than 12,000 people were arrested. Property damage was estimated at more than $1bn. As of March 2020, the US is affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Several large population centers have been effectively shut down as a result of government orders that attempt to slow the spread of the pandemic. As a result of the pandemic and associated economic shutdowns, incidents of panic buying have been reported, and dire predictions of severe economic contraction have been made. Given the potential socio-economic impact of the pandemic, it may become increasingly difficult for many people to maintain their employment or other income source, and as of March 22 2020 it is unclear if the US government will offer all citizens a sufficient measure of economic support during the crisis to maintain the social order. This question asks: Will the United States experience an incident of a massive riot in 2020? For the purposes of this question, 'massive riot' is defined as an event of rioting or civil unrest in which any of the following conditions is met: At least 50 people die due to violence, either due to the actions of rioters or other civilians, or police, military, national guard, or other law enforcement or government agents. At least 10,000 people are arrested by police, military, national guard, or other law enforcement or government agents. Property damages are credibly estimated at $1 billion or more. This estimate may come from either the local government of the locality in which the incident takes place, the state government, the federal government, or a major US news publication such as the New York Times, Washington Post, or major broadcast news networks. Such events should take place in a 100km radius, and within 14 days. As an example, the LA riots would count, but rioting that is spread across all of California or that occurs in separate phases over a long time period would not count if no single incident met any of the above criteria. Resolution should cite a government statement or credible news reports that indicate that any of the above conditions have been met by an event of rioting. ETA 2020-06-03: For homicides to count toward the overall death toll, the deaths have to occur within the context of an event of rioting or civil unrest; deaths from a generic mass shooting or a series of homicides that occur outside of the context of a riot shouldn't count towards the 50.

These lockdowns have meant that many people have been unable to go to work, causing an increase in the unemployment rate, as well as stopping people from going to many shops. On the 18th of March 2020, economist Bryan Caplan wrote a blog post titled \"I Fear Stagflation and Price Controls Are Coming\". Some excerpts: The sudden shutdown of enormous sectors of the U. S.and global economy clearly constitute a massive short-run fall in Aggregate Supply. While Aggregate Demand is going to fall too, this time Aggregate Supply fell first... If AS [Aggregate Supply] falls a lot and AD [Aggregate Demand] falls a little, in contrast, we should expect a return of stagflation \u2013 high unemployment and high inflation simultaneously. The same holds if AS falls enormously and AD \"only\" falls a lot... The upshot: Though I'm not ready to bet on it, I fear that in 2021 we will see not only high unemployment but high inflation as well. . At this point, I would not be surprised by 10% unemployment and 6% inflation for 2021... How bad will the inflation be?... [T]he public outcry against even high single-digit inflation will be deafening. Historically, governments have a standard response to such outcries: economy-wide price controls. Richard Nixon imposed them in 1971 when inflation was only 4.4% and restaurants were open. If and when the government does impose price controls, the textbook tells us what to expect: Ever-growing shortages, rationing, black markets, and anti-business witch-hunts. In this question, we test one aspect of this fear: Will the US see mass price controls in 2021? This question resolves positively if the US federal government institutes a measure described by at least three major US newspapers as \"price controls\", \"price ceilings\", \"price maxima\", or the singular of any of these phrases, or a phrase determined by Metaculus administrators to be equivalent to any of those three, and such measure applies to at least half of products and services in the US economy weighted by GDP, where this determination is also to be made by Metaculus administrators. For the purpose of this question, the following is an exhaustive list of major US newspapers: USA Today The Wall Street Journal The New York Times The Los Angeles Times The Washington Post The Chicago Tribune The Boston Tribune Other questions testing aspects of Caplan's post: What will inflation be in the US in 2021?

            ". The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus is a novel betacoronavirus that likely emerged late last year from an animal reservoir in China. There is little to no pre-existing immunity against it in the human population. The clinical picture for the disease it causes, coronavirus disease 2019 , ranges from very mild to fatal. The virus is highly transmissible and has spread globally. As of 20 March 2020, the WHO is reporting that it is tracking the development of forty-four SARS-CoV-2 candidate vaccines. Two of these candidates have entered phase one and the other forty-two remain in the pre-clinical stage. One of the candidates in phase one is a RNA vaccine candidate, as are seven of the candidates in the pre-clinical stage. RNA vaccines are of particular interest because they can be developed and produced relatively quickly since, unlike other vaccine platforms, they do not require fermentation or culture and instead use faster synthetic processes. As a result, the first SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate to enter a phase one clinical trial is a RNA vaccine, mRNA-1273, which was developed by Moderna Therapeutics at record speed. While promising, RNA-based vaccine platforms are a new development and the field is still nascent. No RNA vaccine has ever made it to market. And since no RNA vaccine has been approved to date, there is an urgent need to determine the likelihood of successful development of such a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2. This question asks: Will a RNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate be approved for use in the United States or European Union before 2022? Resolution will be determined via the first relevant press release made by the FDA, EMA, or European Commission regarding the approval of a RNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate. In the United States, approval means that the vaccine candidate has been licensed by the FDA. In the European Union, approval means that the EMA has recommended the vaccine candidate for approval and the European Commission has granted that approval via marketing authorization. Approval under any other emergency procedures, such as expanded access, would not count. Will a RNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate be approved for use in the United States or European Union before 2022? yes.",
            ". The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus is a novel betacoronavirus that likely emerged late last year from an animal reservoir in China. There is little to no pre-existing immunity against it in the human population. The clinical picture for the disease it causes, coronavirus disease 2019 , ranges from very mild to fatal. The virus is highly transmissible and has spread globally. As of 20 March 2020, the WHO is reporting that it is tracking the development of forty-four SARS-CoV-2 candidate vaccines. Two of these candidates have entered phase one and the other forty-two remain in the pre-clinical stage. One of the candidates in phase one is a RNA vaccine candidate, as are seven of the candidates in the pre-clinical stage. RNA vaccines are of particular interest because they can be developed and produced relatively quickly since, unlike other vaccine platforms, they do not require fermentation or culture and instead use faster synthetic processes. As a result, the first SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate to enter a phase one clinical trial is a RNA vaccine, mRNA-1273, which was developed by Moderna Therapeutics at record speed. While promising, RNA-based vaccine platforms are a new development and the field is still nascent. No RNA vaccine has ever made it to market. And since no RNA vaccine has been approved to date, there is an urgent need to determine the likelihood of successful development of such a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2. This question asks: Will a RNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate be approved for use in the United States or European Union before 2022? Resolution will be determined via the first relevant press release made by the FDA, EMA, or European Commission regarding the approval of a RNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate. In the United States, approval means that the vaccine candidate has been licensed by the FDA. In the European Union, approval means that the EMA has recommended the vaccine candidate for approval and the European Commission has granted that approval via marketing authorization. Approval under any other emergency procedures, such as expanded access, would not count. Will a RNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate be approved for use in the United States or European Union before 2022? no."

One of the most severe incidents in recent history was the 1992 Los Angeles riots, during which more than 60 people were killed, more than 2,350 people were injured, and more than 12,000 people were arrested. Property damage was estimated at more than $1bn. As of 31 May 2020, major US cities have seen civil unrest after the 25 May death of George Floyd in a police encounter. The George Floyd protests are ongoing and some have involved violence. Moreover, much of the US is still under stay-at-home orders related to COVID-19 and unemployment is at record highs. This question asks: Will the United States experience widespread rioting in 2020? For the purposes of this question, 'large-scale rioting' is defined as an event of rioting or civil unrest in which any of the following conditions is met: At least 150 people die due to violence, either due to the actions of rioters or other civilians, or police, military, national guard, or other law enforcement or government agents. At least 30,000 people are arrested by police, military, national guard, or other law enforcement or government agents. Property damages are credibly estimated at $3 billion or more. This estimate may come from local governments in which the incidents take place, state governments, the federal government, or a major US news publication such as the New York Times, Washington Post, or major broadcast news networks. Such events should take place in the US and should occur within a 14 day period.

Over the years, tensions have continued to persist resulting in incidents such as clashes in 1967 and a military standoff in 2017. On May 5th of this year, tensions flared again when Chinese and Indian soldiers clashed along the western border. A video was shared on social media showing soldiers engaging in fistfights and stone-pelting. Indian media claims that 72 Indian soldiers were injured in the incident. On May 10th, near the disputed eastern border, Chinese soldiers crossed over and shouted at Indian forces, telling them the area didn't belong to them. This escalated to violence and 11 soldiers were injured. On May 24th, 1000 Chinese forces crossed 2-3km into territory that India claims is theirs.

Despite the ceasefire declared by China ending the war the same year and diplomatic efforts to define a border, it seems that the issue is still not settled to both sides' satisfaction. Over the years, tensions have continued to persist resulting in incidents such as clashes in 1967 and a military standoff in 2017. This year, tensions have once again flared. Beginning in early May, clashes along the border between Chinese and Indian military forces resulted in some injuries, but no deaths. This changed on the night of June 15th when a deadly brawl broke out in the Galwan Valley near China's eastern border with India. Each side disagrees about what exactly transpired, but Indian officials report that 20 of their soldiers died, some during the clash and some later after succumbing to their injuries. China has not reported how many of their soldiers died. This question asks: Will the violence continue, and result in at least 500 Indian soldier and/or civilian deaths due to conflicts with the Chinese military along the border? Indian deaths are the focus for forecasting because China has not been forthcoming with data on their casualties. The question will resolve positively if all of the following criteria are met: 500 or more Indians are killed as a result of conflicts between Indian and Chinese military forces within 100 miles of the China-India border. These deaths can be the result of more than one incident, and will be tabulated from credible media reports. A death is a result of a military conflict if it was caused by injuries sustained during a conflict between Chinese and Indian military forces.

The red lines on these images disambiguate the border lines in areas where it is disputed. The deaths must result from a conflict that occurs between 2020-05-14 and 2020-12-31 UTC, inclusive of both endpoints. Thus, deaths as a result of the June 15th conflict are counted.

            ". Singapore's political system has been called many things, from \"representative democracy\" , to \"flawed democracy\" , or \"guided democracy\", or even a \"one-party state\". Adam Garfinkle writes, Singapore is a \"managed\" democracy, and let's be frank about what that means: The opposition is not going to win political power short of pigs flying and the moon audibly whistling \"Majulah Singapura.\" The system is subtly but effectively rigged\u2014I mean that. One of the ways in which the system is \"subtly rigged\" is a uniquely Singaporean construct\u2014the \"group representation constituency \".

            ". In early 2016, two Caltech Professors -- Konstantin Batygin and Mike Brown -- created a major media splash by predicting the existence of Planet Nine, a new, but as-yet unseen planet in the outer solar system. As originally envisioned, their trans-Neptunian world has an orbital period of about 20,000 years and a super-Earth mass more than sufficient to bring the Solar System's planetary inventory back up to nine. Batygin and Brown's paper, has been downloaded well over half a million times, and presents indirect dynamical evidence for the planet's existence. Its presence is inferred through the gravitational sculpting that it has produced in the trajectories of the most distant Pluto-like worlds that lie beyond Neptune's orbit. Follow-up papers by a range of authors have added a mixture of credibility, detail, and skepticism to the Planet Nine hypothesis. In the years since the announcement of the hypothesis, Planet Nine has been invoked as an explanation for the generation of highly inclined Kuiper belt objects such as Drac and Niku, it has been argued that it can account for curious orbital among the most distant members of the Kuipier Belt, and it has been hypothesized that it can explain the 6-degree tilt of the planetary orbits relative to the Sun's equator. The planet, however, remains to be found. If it does exist, its most likely sky location is probably in one of the two regions of the sky where the Galactic Plane intersects the ecliptic. Confusion from the myriad stars of the Milky Way's disk renders systematic searches difficult in these areas. Nonetheless, new techniques, such as the use of data from NASA's TESS Mission may potentially provide a breakthrough. Additionally, Batygin and co-authors have published an update to their original paper that contains a significant amount of new analysis and remains optimistic regarding the prospects for eventual detection. It thus seems timely to release this fifth update to our original, now long-closed, Planet Nine question. Specifically: Will the detection of a new Solar System planet occur by July 1, 2021? For this question to resolve as \"Yes\", the new Solar System planet should have an inferred radius larger than that of Earth, and an orbital period greater than 5,000 years.

The youngest child of disgraced publishing tycoon Robert Maxwell, she moved to the United States after her father's death in 1991 and became a close associate of the financier and subsequently convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Maxwell has faced persistent allegations of procuring and sexually trafficking underage girls for Epstein and others, charges she has denied. Epstein was arrested on July 6, 2019, on federal charges for the sex trafficking of minors in Florida and New York. He died in his jail cell on August 10, 2019. The medical examiner ruled the death a suicide, although Epstein's lawyers have disputed the ruling, and there has been huge public skepticism about the true cause of his death, such that the phrase \"Jeffrey Epstein did not kill himself\" has become a meme. On July 2 2020, Maxwell was arrested by the FBI in New Hampshire, and is facing multiple felony charges. This question asks: Will Ghislaine Maxwell be alive on 1 January 2021? This question resolves positively if it is known that Ghislaine Maxwell is still alive on January 1 2021. This question resolves negatively if it is known that Ghislaine Maxwell has died prior to January 1 2021. This question resolves ambiguously if Maxwell's status on January 1 2021 is unknown or disputed . Will Ghislaine Maxwell be alive on 1 January 2021? yes.",

During an arrest made by Chauvin and three other officers, he knelt on George Floyd's neck for almost eight minutes while Floyd was handcuffed and lying face down on a street. The death set off a series of protests around the world. Chauvin was fired by the Minneapolis Police Department the day after the incident. He was initially charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter; a charge of second-degree murder was later added. Some have suggested that he will be acquitted of his murder charges. From a Medium post, There are six crucial pieces of information \u2014 six facts \u2014 that have been largely omitted from discussion on the Chauvin's conduct. Taken together, they likely exonerate the officer of a murder charge. [...] George Floyd was experiencing cardiopulmonary and psychological distress minutes before he was placed on the ground, let alone had a knee to his neck. The Minneapolis Police Department allows the use of neck restraint on suspects who actively resist arrest, and George Floyd actively resisted arrest on two occasions, including immediately prior to neck restraint being used. The officers were recorded on their body cams assessing George Floyd as suffering from \"excited delirium syndrome\" , a condition which the MPD considers an extreme threat to both the officers and the suspect. A white paper used by the MPD acknowledges that ExDS suspects may die irrespective of force involved. The officers' response to this situation was in line with MPD guidelines for ExDS. Restraining the suspect on his or her abdomen is a common tactic in ExDS situations, and the white paper used by the MPD instructs the officers to control the suspect until paramedics arrive. Floyd's autopsy revealed a potentially lethal concoction of drugs \u2014 not just a potentially lethal dose of fentanyl, but also Together with his history of drug abuse and two serious heart conditions, Floyd's condition was exceptionally and unusually fragile. Chauvin's neck restraint is unlikely to have exerted a dangerous amount of force to Floyd's neck. Floyd is shown on video able to lift his head and neck, and a robust study on double-knee restraints showed a median force exertion of approximately approximately 105lbs. This question resolves positively if Derek Chauvin is acquitted of ALL murder \u2020 charges OR all murder charges against him are dropped. Otherwise, it resolves negatively. If he dies before resolution, the question resolves ambiguously. \u2020 Only convictions for offences actually called \"murder\" trigger negative resolution ; conviction for other offences such as manslaughter does not.

Floyd's autopsy revealed a potentially lethal concoction of drugs \u2014 not just a potentially lethal dose of fentanyl, but also Together with his history of drug abuse and two serious heart conditions, Floyd's condition was exceptionally and unusually fragile. Chauvin's neck restraint is unlikely to have exerted a dangerous amount of force to Floyd's neck. Floyd is shown on video able to lift his head and neck, and a robust study on double-knee restraints showed a median force exertion of approximately approximately 105lbs. This question resolves positively if Derek Chauvin is acquitted of ALL murder \u2020 charges OR all murder charges against him are dropped. Otherwise, it resolves negatively. If he dies before resolution, the question resolves ambiguously. \u2020 Only convictions for offences actually called \"murder\" trigger negative resolution ; conviction for other offences such as manslaughter does not. Will Derek Chauvin be acquitted of all murder charges? no."

It would arguably be the biggest non-pandemic disaster in history and have devastating second-order effects, including: exacerbation of the coronavirus, famine, nuclear radiation worse than Fukushima, further instability in Great Power dynamics, and global economic It is no exaggeration to say that a sudden collapse of this dam could be the spark of cascading civilizational collapse. It is worth examining even if the risk is small. From the National Review: China has been suffering through record rains the past weeks, leading to the worst flooding in the country in decades. There is little relief in sight, and the Yangtze River is now above flood level, according to China's Ministry of Water Resources. A few days ago, officials admitted that certain \"peripheral\" structures of the massive Three Gorges Dam deformed due to the building water pressure. Stunning pictures of water being released to relieve pressure are raising the specter of whether the entire dam could fail . Some online satellite photos purporting to show the buckling of the dam, however, should be viewed with skepticism. Still, the damage that has already occurred from the record deluge is significant, with numerous cities upriver from the dam already flooded[...] All that would be dwarfed if the Three Gorges Dam failed. The dam was built from 1994 to 2006, at a cost of $31 billion and displacing 1.4 million people for its construction, precisely to lessen the risk of devastating flooding along the Yangtze, a perennial problem in China since ancient times. The river's basin accounts for nearly half of China's agricultural output, and it runs through major cities, such as Wuhan, with 10 million people. Chinese authorities have already evacuated 38 million people downriver. The dam can hold back waters to a level of 175 meters above sea level; according to the Bureau of Hydrology of the Chanjiang Water Resources Commission, the latest height at the dam was 158.85 meters, down from 164 meters on Tuesday. Yet more rain is predicted, and if smaller, older dams upriver from Three Gorges overflow or fail, then the pressure on the main dam could quickly overwhelm either its capacity or even its structural integrity. While an outright failure of the dam may not be the primary danger, nonetheless its geopolitical consequences are staggering to contemplate. It would be a black swan of epic proportions, China's Chernobyl moment. A tsunami-like wave from a breach in the Three Gorges Dam could wipe out millions of acres of farmland right before the autumn harvest, possibly leading to famine-like conditions. As it is also the world's largest hydroelectric power station, a failure would lead to huge power outages.

            ". US president Trump has declared his intentions to add Antifa to list of terrorist organizations, tweeting May 31st: The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization. US Texan Senator Ted Cruz has similarly been campaigning for this move: Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, is aiming to highlight the role Antifa and like-minded groups are playing in riots across the country, convening a Senate hearing Tuesday on the issue while alleging that radical left-wing groups are engaging in \"organized terror attacks\" designed to tear down government institutions. \"Across the country, we're seeing horrific violence, we're seeing our country torn apart. Violent anarchists and Marxists are exploiting protests to transform them into riots and direct assaults on the lives and safety of their fellow Americans,\" Cruz told Fox News in an interview. Unsurprisingly Trump's opponents have opposed this move, and even labelled it impossible. For instance, in Slate, we can read: While the president and attorney general may have political motivations for wanting to stigmatize a left-wing movement by tagging it with the terrorist label and thus seek to assign blame for the violence engulfing several U. S.major cities, it is unlikely that Trump can do so within existing legal authorities. In the United States, there are two competent authorities for designating terrorist groups. First, the Department of State can designate groups as Foreign Terrorist Organizations pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act. It can also designate both groups and individuals as terrorists under Executive Order 13224. This order was established shortly after Sept. 11 as part of an effort to provide the State and Treasury departments enhanced capability to block terrorists from the U. S.formal financial system. However, for the State Department to designate a group, it must document that the organization operates overseas, and that the group's leaders, camps, and operations are based outside of the continental United States. Antifa, by virtue of its domestic presence and lack of any organizational cohesion, would be impossible for the State Department to designate. The Treasury Department can also sanction terrorists per Executive Order 13224. But it can only piggy-back on an already existing designation of a group, typically one that is already labeled by the State Department as a terrorist organization. Without an underlying State Department designation, the Treasury Department can't act. And, while Treasury has designated a number of domestic-based charities as terrorist entities, those groups were linked to foreign organizations such as Hamas, the Tamil Tigers, Lebanese Hizballah, and al-Qaida. So it appears to be difficult for the Trump administration to accomplish this. Thus, the question is: Will Antifa officially be labelled a terrorist organization in the US before 2022? Antifa must be added to an official list of terrorist organizations for this to resolve positively. They must remain on this list for at least seven consecutive days. It must happen before 2022. It can happen under any presidency . An \"official list is\" one that appears on the public-facing website of a US federal agency.

            ". As reported by Al-Jazeera 21st August 2020: Former White House adviser Steve Bannon, an architect of Donald Trump's 2016 election victory, was arrested on a yacht and pleaded not guilty on Thursday after being charged with defrauding donors in a scheme to help build the president's signature wall along the US-Mexico border. The charges were contained in an indictment unsealed in Manhattan federal court, which alleges Bannon and three others \"orchestrated a scheme to defraud hundreds of thousands of donors\". The indictment claims the \"scheme\" was related to an online crowdfunding campaign that claims to have raised more than $25m to build a wall along the southern border of the United States.has the various versions of the story across media outlets. The official charges are as follows: BRIAN KOLFAGE, STEPHEN BANNON, ANDREW BADOLATO, and TIMOTHY SHEA, the defendants, and others, orchestrated a scheme to defraud hundreds of thousands of donors, including donors in the Southern District of New York, in connection with an online crowdfunding campaign ultimately known as \"We Build The Wall\" that raised more than $25,000,000 to build a wall along the southern border of the United States. To induce donors to donate to the campaign, KOLFAGE and BANNON - each of whom, as detailed herein, exerted significant control over We Build the Wall - repeatedly and falsely assured the public that KOLFAGE would \"not take a penny in salary or compensation\" and that \"100% of the funds raised ..will be used in the execution of our mission and purpose\" because, as BANNON publicly stated, \"we're a volunteer organization.\" Those representations were false. In truth, BRIAN KOLFAGE, STEPHEN BANNON, ANDREW BADOLATO, and TIMOTHY SHEA, the defendants, collectively received hundreds of thousands of dollars in donor funds from We Build the Wall, which they each used in a manner inconsistent with the organization's public In particular, KOLFAGE covertly took more than $350,000 in funds that had been donated to We Build the Wall for his personal use, while BANNON, through a non-profit organization under his control , received over $1,000,000 from We Build the Wall, which BANNON used to, among other things, secretly pay KOLFAGE and to cover hundreds of thousands of dollars in BANNON's personal expenses. To conceal the payments to KOLFAGE from We Build the Wall, KOLFAGE, BANNON, BADOLATO, and SHEA devised a scheme to route those payments from We Build the Wall to KOLFAGE indirectly through Non-Profit-1 and a shell company under SHEA's control, among other avenues. They did so by using fake invoices and sham \"vendor\" arrangements, among other ways, to ensure, as KOLFAGE noted in a text message to BADOLATO, that his pay arrangement remained \"confidential\" and kept on a \"need to know\" basis. Will Bannon be found guilty of at least one fraud charge? The resolution concerns the first verdict. We may make another question about an eventual appealed case .

As reported by Al-Jazeera 21st August 2020: Former White House adviser Steve Bannon, an architect of Donald Trump's 2016 election victory, was arrested on a yacht and pleaded not guilty on Thursday after being charged with defrauding donors in a scheme to help build the president's signature wall along the US-Mexico border. The charges were contained in an indictment unsealed in Manhattan federal court, which alleges Bannon and three others \"orchestrated a scheme to defraud hundreds of thousands of donors\". The indictment claims the \"scheme\" was related to an online crowdfunding campaign that claims to have raised more than $25m to build a wall along the southern border of the United States.has the various versions of the story across media outlets. The official charges are as follows: BRIAN KOLFAGE, STEPHEN BANNON, ANDREW BADOLATO, and TIMOTHY SHEA, the defendants, and others, orchestrated a scheme to defraud hundreds of thousands of donors, including donors in the Southern District of New York, in connection with an online crowdfunding campaign ultimately known as \"We Build The Wall\" that raised more than $25,000,000 to build a wall along the southern border of the United States. To induce donors to donate to the campaign, KOLFAGE and BANNON - each of whom, as detailed herein, exerted significant control over We Build the Wall - repeatedly and falsely assured the public that KOLFAGE would \"not take a penny in salary or compensation\" and that \"100% of the funds raised ..will be used in the execution of our mission and purpose\" because, as BANNON publicly stated, \"we're a volunteer organization.\" Those representations were false. In truth, BRIAN KOLFAGE, STEPHEN BANNON, ANDREW BADOLATO, and TIMOTHY SHEA, the defendants, collectively received hundreds of thousands of dollars in donor funds from We Build the Wall, which they each used in a manner inconsistent with the organization's public In particular, KOLFAGE covertly took more than $350,000 in funds that had been donated to We Build the Wall for his personal use, while BANNON, through a non-profit organization under his control , received over $1,000,000 from We Build the Wall, which BANNON used to, among other things, secretly pay KOLFAGE and to cover hundreds of thousands of dollars in BANNON's personal expenses. To conceal the payments to KOLFAGE from We Build the Wall, KOLFAGE, BANNON, BADOLATO, and SHEA devised a scheme to route those payments from We Build the Wall to KOLFAGE indirectly through Non-Profit-1 and a shell company under SHEA's control, among other avenues. They did so by using fake invoices and sham \"vendor\" arrangements, among other ways, to ensure, as KOLFAGE noted in a text message to BADOLATO, that his pay arrangement remained \"confidential\" and kept on a \"need to know\" basis. Will Bannon be found guilty of at least one fraud charge? The resolution concerns the first verdict. We may make another question about an eventual appealed case . Only the ones in this case are relevant. If Bannon is indicted with unrelated fraud charges, these are irrelevant for this question. Will Bannon be found guilty of at least one fraud charge? no."

            ". From the BBC, Uber and Lyft have been granted a reprieve in a row over drivers' employment rights in California after a court granted an emergency injunction. The ride-hailing firms had threatened to suspend operations over an earlier ruling that they must classify drivers as employees, not contractors. But the reprieve allows them to continue operating while the court considers their case for appeal. The court's decision came just hours before Lyft was due to halt rides. The court has ordered Uber and Lyft to both submit their plans for hiring employees by early September, and oral arguments in the case are set for mid-October. Lyft was due to stop its services in California at 23:59 local time on Thursday . [...] [Uber and Lyft] have always argued their drivers are self-employed contractors. But a California law that came into effect earlier this year, known as AB5, extended employee classification to workers in the \"gig economy\". The judge's ruling that the law applied to both Uber and Lyft means the firms need to provide drivers with extra benefits, such as unemployment protection. Both companies filed an appeal to the judgement - and asked for a stay on its enforcement while the courts dealt with the appeal. Unless the stay was granted, both companies had 10 days to undertake what they saw as a significant overhaul of their business in California. They both warned that they could be forced to pull services from the state at the end of the day on Thursday. [...] There is a potential way out for the ride-sharing firms in the coming months. A ballot that will be put to vote in November, at the same time as the US presidential election, would grant Uber and Lyft an exemption from the law. It is known as proposition 22. \"Your voice can help,\" Lyft wrote in its blog post about suspending services. \"Prop 22, proposes the necessary changes to give drivers benefits and flexibility, while maintaining the rideshare model that helps you get where you need to go,\" it said. This question resolves positively if both Uber and Lyft are operating in California on June 1st 2021. Otherwise, it resolves negatively. For the sake of this question, \"operating in California\" is taken to mean that, in at least one city, general consumers can receive Uber and Lyft rides. Determination is made via credible media reports. Will Uber and Lyft both be operating in California on June 1st 2021? yes.",

Biden Jr.will debate with a single moderator at each of their three matchups, the Commission on Presidential Debates announced on Wednesday, September 2. The first debate of the general election, on Sept. 29, will be moderated by the \"Fox News Sunday\" anchor Chris Wallace. Mr. Wallace received high marks for his debut debate in 2016 and is known for his sharp interviewing style. Joe Biden, 77, is the oldest major party nominee in US history, and his opponents have claimed that he is not as mentally sharp as he once was. Indeed, a June 2020 Rasmussen Reports national telephone and online survey found that 38% of likely U. S.voters think Biden is suffering from some form of dementia. This has led some to question whether the debates between Trump and Biden could be a turning point in the election campaign. Trump currently trails Biden in the 538 polling average by 7.4%; Biden has 50.4% in the polling average, and Trump is on 43%. Politico reports that Trump's advisers are watching Biden closely and \"studying Biden's idiosyncrasies to identify ways to trip him up on the debate stage.\" Will Biden drop by at least 5 percentage points in the polls after the first debate? For a positive resolution, Biden's polling average as reported by 538 must drop by at least five full percentage points relative to the number reported as of 00:00 on September 29, the day the first debate is to take place, before 00:00 on October 14, both dates in Eastern Time. For example, if Biden has 48.5% in the polling average on September 29, he must drop to 43.5% or lower before October 14 for a positive resolution.

The correspondent and geneticist each comment that the genes responsible for skin pigmentation in humans are completely different to the genes in these animals. It therefore makes no sense to extrapolate from these animal studies to humans.

Petrov Day is the yearly anniversary of the 1983 Soviet nuclear false alarm incident on September 26th, in which Stanislav Petrov received alerts that five nuclear weapons had been launched by the US, later found to be caused by the mistaken detection of high-altitude clouds. Petrov suspected that it was a false alarm and, against protocol, decided not to send reports up the chain of command; this decision may have prevented a full-scale nuclear war between the US and the Soviet Union. One proposed way to celebrate Petrov day is to create a metaphor for the situation Petrov was in, with a big red button with much lower stakes: And you can also play on hard mode: \"During said ceremony, unveil a large red button. If anybody presses the button, the ceremony is over. Go home. Do not speak.\" Lesswrong has hosted an event along these lines in 2019 and in 2020. In 2019, 125 users were given \"launch codes\" that, if input into a red button on the front page, would take down the site for the day. In 2020, the same was done with 270 users. The site was not took down in 2019, and was took down in 2020. If Lesswrong holds a similar Petrov Day event in 2021, will the \"red button\" be pressed? If the site hosts a 2021 Petrov day event, and a group of Lesswrong users are given the choice to take a unilateral action that ends the 2021 Petrov day event , then this will resolve positively if one of them takes that action and negatively if none of them do. Otherwise, this resolves ambigiously. If Lesswrong holds a similar Petrov Day event in 2021, will the \"red button\" be pressed? yes.",

Kraska also said, from the next week on, the criteria of assigning cities and counties to yellow and red zones would be tightened. He added that this correction rate was unfavorable for big cities, as due to high number of residents they were much more likely to be marked yellow or red.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus is a novel betacoronavirus that likely emerged late last year from an animal reservoir in China. There is little to no pre-existing immunity against it in the human population. The clinical picture for the disease it causes, coronavirus disease 2019 , ranges from very mild to fatal. The virus is highly transmissible and has spread globally. As of 22 September 2020, the World Health Organization is reporting that it is tracking the development of thirty-eight SARS-CoV-2 candidate vaccines under clinical evaluation. There is an urgent need to determine when the first of these candidates will have been found to have a high degree of efficacy and will have been administered to a significant number of people. The WHO defines vaccine efficacy as follows: Vaccine efficacy: % reduction in disease incidence in a vaccinated group compared to an unvaccinated group under optimal conditions This question asks: Will a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate that has demonstrated an efficacy rate >75% in a n>500 RCT be administered to 10M people by March 1st 2021? This question resolves positively if by the 1st of March 2021 a credible article is published that presents the claim that at least 10 million people have been administered a vaccine that had been previously shown to have an efficacy rate exceeding >75% in a randomized controlled trial with at least 500 participants.

Consumer confidence is an important economic indicator, reflecting consumers' optimism regarding the state of the economy and the outlook for their personal financial future. The indicator is tied to people's propensity to spend and save in the near-term. The OECD publishes a Consumer Confidence Indicator on monthly basis. Values over 100 indicate economic optimism, while values under 100 represent pessimism. In January 2020, the CCI in the US was set at 101.57. In the shadow of the COVID-19 pandemic and government restrictions in March-April 2020, consumer confidence in the US took a plunge. Since then the index has been on rise, but has not yet recovered to pre-pandemic levels. This question asks: For the month of January 2021, will Consumer Confidence in the United States return to optimism?

            ". Techcrunch, 6th October 2020: John McAfee arrested after DOJ indicts crypto millionaire for tax evasion: Cybersecurity entrepreneur and crypto personality John McAfee's wild ride could be coming to an end after he was arrested in Spain today, and now faces extradition to the U. S.over charges spanning tax evasion and fraud. The SEC accuses McAfee of being paid more than $23.1 million worth of cryptocurrency assets for promoting a number of ICO token sales without disclosing that he was being paid to do so. Furthermore the DOJ has levied a number of counts of tax evasion against McAfee, saying that he \"willfully attempted to evade\" payment of income taxes owed to the federal government. In a brief announcing the arrest and unsealing of indictment documents, the DOJ also details that the charges are confined to McAfee the individual and that they did not find any connection with the \"anti-virus company bearing his name.\" The DOJ's charges against McAfee are a bit dry, but detail 10 counts against the entrepreneur. McAfee faced five counts of tax evasion, which each carry a maximum penalty of five years in prison, as well as five counts of \"willful failure to file a tax return,\" each carrying a maximum penalty of one year in prison. The SEC filing is a much more interesting read, with 55 pages detailing a lengthy investigation into McAfee's alleged fraudulent activity promoting a number of ICOs throughout 2017 and 2018. The report specifically notes that McAfee allegedly received more than $11.6 million worth of BTC and ETH tokens for promoting seven ICOs. Unfortunately, those offerings were not named in the suit. He additionally received $11.5 million worth of the promoted tokens, the suit alleges. Will John McAfee receive a prison term of at least 3 years? If John McAfee pleads guilty or is found guilty and receives a prison sentence of at least 3 years, this question resolves positively. If he receives a lighter or no prison sentence, it resolves negatively. If McAfee avoids extraction to USA and in this way avoids facing charges, the question resolves negatively at the closing date. Positive resolution does not require McAfee to actually finish his three year sentence. Serving a combined total exceeding 3 years in pre-trail detention and post-trail detention is sufficient for positive resolution. If this question does not resolve positively before 2025-01-01, this question resolves negatively. Will John McAfee receive a prison term of at least 3 years? yes.",

If John McAfee pleads guilty or is found guilty and receives a prison sentence of at least 3 years, this question resolves positively. If he receives a lighter or no prison sentence, it resolves negatively. If McAfee avoids extraction to USA and in this way avoids facing charges, the question resolves negatively at the closing date. Positive resolution does not require McAfee to actually finish his three year sentence. Serving a combined total exceeding 3 years in pre-trail detention and post-trail detention is sufficient for positive resolution. If this question does not resolve positively before 2025-01-01, this question resolves negatively. Will John McAfee receive a prison term of at least 3 years? no."

North Korea has also fired a number of short-range missiles into the Sea of Japan , in what have been interpreted as political gestures. Despite a tentative cooling of tensions between North Korea and the US in 2018 and 2019, Kim Jong-Un stated in late December 2019 that North Korea would no longer adhere to a moratorium on ICBM and nuclear testing, and that North Korea would soon demonstrate a 'new strategic weapon.' In October 2020, North Korea unveiled a new ballistic missile at a military parade to mark 75 years of the Workers' Party of Korea. The massive weapon was carried by an 11-axle truck at the climax of the almost two-hour ceremony and military parade in the capital of Pyongyang. Analysts said the new missile is not known to have been tested, but a bigger weapon would allow North Korea to put multiple warheads on it, increasing the threat it would pose to any targeted foe. \"Largest road-mobile liquid-fueled missile anywhere, to be clear,\" tweeted Ankit Panda, senior fellow in the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"Liquid fuel, Huuuuge, capable of carrying MIRV nuclear warheads,\" tweeted Melissa Hanham, deputy director of Open Nuclear Network at Stanford University.

            ". Gladys Berejiklian has been Premier of New South Wales, Australia's most populous state, since January 2017. Her term has encompassed both the devastating bush fires of January 2020 and the COVID-19 crisis. Over the last week, it has been revealed at the Independent Commission Against Corruption that Berejiklian had a five year 'close personal relationship' with another member of State Parliament, Daryl Maguire. Maguire resigned in 2018 after it was revealed that he had sought inappropriate payments in return for favours to developers. Over the last week ICAC has found that not only did Maguire receive payments from developers in return for favours, he was also involved in a 'cash for visa's scam' targeting Chinese nationals. Ms Berejiklian has not been directly implicated in either scheme. The NSW parliamentary system gives members of the party in government the ability to vote on their leader, and so change the Premier outside of an election. Leaders may also resign and can be removed by the Governor. Over the last 20 years, NSW has had 7 premiers. Of these, 1 was defeated by a leadership spill, 4 resigned, and 1 lost an election. Notably, Barry O'Farrell resigned his premiership in 2014 after it was found he had misled the Independent Commission Against Corruption. [Short Fuse] Will Gladys Berejiklian cease to be Premier of NSW by 1 December 2020? The question will resolve positively if, before 1 December 2020, it is reported by two or more major news sources in Australia that Ms Berejiklian is no longer Premier of NSW. For the purposes of this question, major news sources in Australia are the ABC, The Sydney Morning Herald, The Guardian, The Australian. The question will close 24 hours before the event occurs. Will Gladys Berejiklian cease to be Premier of NSW by 1 December 2020? yes.",
            ". Gladys Berejiklian has been Premier of New South Wales, Australia's most populous state, since January 2017. Her term has encompassed both the devastating bush fires of January 2020 and the COVID-19 crisis. Over the last week, it has been revealed at the Independent Commission Against Corruption that Berejiklian had a five year 'close personal relationship' with another member of State Parliament, Daryl Maguire. Maguire resigned in 2018 after it was revealed that he had sought inappropriate payments in return for favours to developers. Over the last week ICAC has found that not only did Maguire receive payments from developers in return for favours, he was also involved in a 'cash for visa's scam' targeting Chinese nationals. Ms Berejiklian has not been directly implicated in either scheme. The NSW parliamentary system gives members of the party in government the ability to vote on their leader, and so change the Premier outside of an election. Leaders may also resign and can be removed by the Governor. Over the last 20 years, NSW has had 7 premiers. Of these, 1 was defeated by a leadership spill, 4 resigned, and 1 lost an election. Notably, Barry O'Farrell resigned his premiership in 2014 after it was found he had misled the Independent Commission Against Corruption. [Short Fuse] Will Gladys Berejiklian cease to be Premier of NSW by 1 December 2020?

Over the years, North Korea has conducted a number of missile tests as part of an arms development program. North Korea has also fired a number of short-range missiles into the Sea of Japan , in what have been interpreted as political gestures. Despite a tentative cooling of tensions between North Korea and the US in 2018 and 2019, Kim Jong-Un stated in late December 2019 that North Korea would no longer adhere to a moratorium on ICBM and nuclear testing, and that North Korea would soon demonstrate a 'new strategic weapon.' In October 2020, North Korea unveiled a new ballistic missile at a military parade to mark 75 years of the Workers' Party of Korea. This question asks: Will North Korea launch an ballistic missile between November 3rd 2020 and March 1st 2021? This question will resolve positively if a missile with a range of more than 5,500 km, is launched by the North Korean government. Resolution is by credible media report, with assessment provided by US or UK government, or by a statement of confirmation that this has happened given by any permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. Note that the missile must not necessarily be launched successfully for a positive resolution; any confirmed launch will suffice. If an ballistic missile is tested, even if the test fails, the question resolves positively.

There are mounting concerns that the nearing US presidential elections will be contested. Sitting president Donald Trump has attacked the legitimacy of the voting system and publicly refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power in the event that he loses the election. In light of the complications and time involved in resolving a contested election, some have warned of civil unrest and the possibility of violent outbreaks following the election. This question asks: Will there be at least 10 fatalites caused in post-election political violence in the United States? This question resolves on the basis of credible media reports that link deaths to violence. Note that such deaths must occur as a direct result of violent confrontation that is primarily linked to election activity. For example, a fatal clash at the polls or at an protest would count.

            ". From the Kaiser Family Foundation, The Affordable Care Act's future continues to be uncertain as the law's will once again be considered by the U. S. Supreme Court in California v. Texas . Oral argument is scheduled for Tuesday, November 10, 2020. This ongoing litigation challenges the ACA's minimum essential coverage provision and raises questions about the entire law's survival. The individual mandate provides that most people must maintain a minimum level of health insurance coverage; those who do not do so must pay a financial penalty to the IRS. The individual mandate was upheld as a constitutional exercise of Congress' taxing power by a five member majority of the Supreme Court in NFIB v. Sebelius in 2012. In the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act , Congress set the shared responsibility payment at zero dollars as of January 1, 2019, leading to the current litigation. In December 2019, the U. S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit affirmed the trial court's decision that the individual mandate is no longer constitutional because the associated financial penalty no longer \"produces at least some revenue\" for the federal government. But, instead of deciding whether the rest of the ACA must be struck down, the 5th Circuit sent the case back to the trial court for additional analysis. However, the Supreme Court has now agreed to review the case. The ACA remains in effect while the litigation is pending. However, if all or most of the law ultimately is struck down, it will have complex and far-reaching consequences for the nation's health care system, affecting nearly everyone in some way. A host of ACA provisions could be eliminated, including protections for people with pre-existing conditions, subsidies to make individual health insurance more affordable, expanded eligibility for Medicaid, coverage of young adults up to age 26 under their parents' insurance policies, coverage of preventive care with no patient cost-sharing, closing of the doughnut hole under Medicare's drug benefit, and a series of tax increases to fund these initiatives. Will the Supreme Court of the US uphold the lower court's ruling in California v. Texas? This question resolves positively if credible media report that the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit to declare parts of the Affordable Care Act and the minimum essential coverage provision Fine print Will the Supreme Court of the US uphold the lower court's ruling in California v.

Nate Silver and his FiveThirtyEight site has achieved significant notoriety for developing a system to carefully aggregate election polls to create well-calibrated statistical forecasts of outcome elections; his site publishes daily updates to predictions for primary and general elections in House, Senate and Presidential races. Prediction markets have offered an alternative to poll aggregation in forecasting elections. Markets such as InTrade, the Iowa Electronic Markets, PredictIt, and others ask users to buy and sell shares assigned to each candidate in each race, so that the price point corresponds to the probability of victory. In this question we focus on PredictIt, which allows users to place relatively small real-money bets on candidates. Both FiveThirtyEight and PredictIt have published probabilities for each state in the 2020 Presidential Election. Which forecasts will prove to be more accurate? Will 538 outperform PredictIt forecasting the 2020 Presidential Elections? To compare, we will score each set of predictions using a Brier score averaged over all N=51 races, computed as where enumerates the possible outcomes in the th race out of N, where is the forecast probability of candidate winning the th race, and is assigned 1 if candidate wins the th race, and 0 otherwise. For example, if PredictIt assigned 52% to Trump and 48% to Biden in Texas and if Trump won then PredictIt would achieve a Brier Score of A lower Brier score is better, with perfect predictions corresponding to S=0. This question resolves positively if the Brier score for the 51 races is lower for 538's probabilities than for PredictIt's probabilities, where we will take values as of 1400 UTC on 02-Nov-2020, and election outcomes as reported over the coming days. To obtain the PredictIt probabilities, we will download the market data from here ; take the average of the prices for each contract (ie + bestBuyYesCost + + )/4) ; and convert to probabilities as Dem_Probability = Dem_Price / . To obtain the 538 probabilities we will download the CSV from here and take the winstate_inc for Republicans and winstate_chal for Democrats in each state.

China instituted the NEV mandate \"which promotes new energy vehicles, such as electric vehicles, and provides additional compliance flexibility to existing fuel consumption regulations.\" This mandate applies to passenger vehicles only, and currently 60% of global car sales from China are covered by it. The NEV mandate specified credit targets for 2019 and 2020 , but has recently expanded targets to 2021-23 as well. The International Energy Association states that: \"Each NEV is assigned a specific number of credits depending on metrics including electric range, energy efficiency, and rated power of fuel cell systems.

Assuming that all manufacturers produce vehicles with a per-vehicle NEV credit of three in 2020, for example, the market share of NEVs in China based on the number of vehicles sold would be around 4% in 2020 while still meeting the 12% target based on NEV credits.\" China expects an NEV credit target of 14% in 2021 and a 2% increase for each following year until 2023, with an ending credit of 18%. Vehicle producers need to hit the number of credits needed each year, either by producing or importing a set number of new energy passenger vehicles. There is also a market for these credits which can be sold and traded between companies, as well as the option to use surplus credits to offset CAFC credit deficits. As credits grow, the number of electric vehicles in China's fleet should increase and consumer adoption along with it, thereby greatly reducing the amount of carbon emissions from transportation and setting China on its path to become carbon neutral by 2060.

As of November 8th, 2020 Donald Trump has still not conceded the election, despite multiple news networks projecting his opponent Joe Biden to be the next president of the United States. While his court cases are pending, ProPublica has noted, It's not likely the recount requests or ballot challenges, which are common in the wake of close elections, will make a difference in the outcome. \"Recounts rarely change the vote totals very much,\" said University of Kentucky law professor Joshua Douglas, and the same is true of challenges to the validity of ballots. Some have considered the possibility that a disgraced Trump will be dragged out of the White House on inaguration day. Scott Aaronson writes, Now that Trump has gone this far in shattering all the norms of succession, part of me wants to see him go the rest of the way \u2026 to being physically dragged out of the Oval Office by Secret Service agents on January 20, in pathetic and humiliating footage that would define how future generations remembered him. Will Trump freely leave the White House? This question resolves positively if at least 3 credible media sources all independently report evidence that Trump left the White House willingly, and free from force or the threat of force on or before inauguration day 2021, with no evidence of intention to return . Otherwise, it resolves negatively. A threat of force is constituted by an order by a legitimate authority, such as a Secret Service agent or a judge. In other words, at least one person who has legal authority to forcefully order Trump to leave the White House must order/force him to leave for this question to resolve negatively.

Of these, one was defeated by a leadership spill, four resigned, and one lost an election.

            ". Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been on trial in the Jerusalem District Court since May 2020 for bribery, fraud and breach of trust. Netanyahu has been indicted in three separate cases: Case 1000 accuses him of receiving gifts in exchange for favors, Case 2000 accuses him of offering to promote the circulation of a newspaper in exchange for favorable coverage, and Case 4000 accuses him of helping a shareholder in a telecom company with regulatory issues in exchange for positive coverage. The evidentiary stage of the trial is set to begin in February 2021, though this may be delayed. Will Netanyahu be convicted by the end of 2021? This will resolve on the basis of an official court statement or otherwise credible media reporting announcing that Netanyahu has been convicted on at least one charge. Conviction on any charge unrelated to this trial would also count for positive resolution. Will Netanyahu be convicted by the end of 2021? no."

Note: this criteria may exclude many editorials or published claims that don't include simulations or empirical data comparing counterfactual mortality with a delayed booster. Question will resolve \"No\" if more than 50% of studies meeting these criteria claim that a longer delay before the second dose would probably increase mortality. Question receives mixed resolution if neither the criteria for \"Yes\" or \"No\" are met. This would happen if, for example, most studies meeting the inclusion criteria don't indicate that either the originally scheduled or a delayed 2nd dose is likely to have saved lives overall. Will scientists conclude that delaying SARS-CoV2 vaccines second dose did or would have saved lives? no."

            ". On December 16th, 2020 England's health secretary, Matt Hancock, announced that a new variant of SARS-CoV-2 had been detected in the UK. Amid worries that the new variant may be more transmissible, PM Boris Johnson announced new lockdowns in London and England's southeast, including a ban on Christmas gatherings. The new variant is said to account for 60% of the infections in London. The spread of a new variant has prompted concerns that a mutation in SARS-CoV-2 could lead to the currently approved vaccines and treatments becoming less effective. The British Medical Journal has the following to say about this possibility: The new variant has mutations to the spike protein that the three leading vaccines are targeting. However, vaccines produce antibodies against many regions in the spike protein, so it's unlikely that a single change would make the vaccine less effective. Over time, as more mutations occur, the vaccine may need to be altered. This happens with seasonal flu, which mutates every year, and the vaccine is adjusted accordingly. The SARS-CoV-2 virus doesn't mutate as quickly as the flu virus, and the vaccines that have so far proved effective in trials are types that can easily be tweaked if necessary. Peacock said, \"With this variant there is no evidence that it will evade the vaccination or a human immune response. But if there is an instance of vaccine failure or reinfection then that case should be treated as high priority for genetic sequencing.\" If there is a mutation and the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine must be updated, it is possible the United States CDC will start recommending revaccination with an updated vaccine. This question asks how likely that scenario is. Before 2023, will the United States CDC recommend that those who have already been vaccinated for SARS-CoV-2 be vaccinated again due to a mutation in the virus? This question resolves positively if and only if before 2023 the United States CDC posts guidance on their website that those who have been vaccinated should get vaccinated again. The guidance must mention that one reason for revaccination is a mutation in SARS-CoV-2.

Another variant under concern is 501. V2, which was first detected in South Africa and reported by the country's health department on 18 December 2020.

Resolution This question resolves positively if credible evidence indicates that a single variant that is at least 30% more transmissible than preexisting variants infects 10M worldwide before 2021-06-02. Evidence that emerges on the resolution date may be consulted. For a single variant to be considered at least 30.0% more transmissible than preexisting variants, a credible meta-analysis or systematic review of at least 5 studies indicates that the Sars-CoV-2 variant is at least 30% more transmissible than were dominant previously. Specifically, it must indicate that its effective reproductive number Rt is estimated to be 30% greater than that of the previously dominant variant, holding all else constant.

            ". CDU - the Christian Democratic Union of Germany is the major party of the center-right in German politics: The CDU has headed the federal government since 2005 under Angela Merkel, who also served as the party's leader from 2000 until 2018. The CDU previously led the federal government from 1949 to 1969 and 1982 to 1998. Germany's three longest-serving post-war Chancellors have all come from the CDU; Helmut Kohl , Angela Merkel , and Konrad Adenauer . The party also leads the governments of six of Germany's sixteen states. --CDU, wikipedia CDU currently forms a coalition government with CSU , and SPD . CDU and CSU hold an agreement that CDU does not run candidates in Bavaria, while CSU does not run candidates anywhere besides Bavaria. In forming this alliance, it is not unlikely that CSU may appoint the next chancellor following the elections, even if they win fewer seats than CDU. The 2021 German federal election is expected to be held on 2021-09-26, the date chosen by President Steinmeier. However, there is still a possibility of the snap election at an earlier date. As of the moment of writing this question, the CDU/CSU union steadily leads in election polls. In Vox's Future Perfect series, Dylan Matthews forecasted an 80% chance that CDU will continue to govern Germany throughout 2021. Will the Chancellor of Germany following the next election be from the CDU/CSU union? This question resolves positive if the Chancellor of Germany is from the CDU or CSU when they are elected after the next Bundestag Election. If they are a member of any other party, the question resolves negative. The election need not happen on 2021-09-26 nor must the chancellor be elected immediately. In the case there is an acting government while parties negotiate to form a formal government, this question will wait to resolve until a new government is formed. In the case an election is scheduled earlier, the question will close 1 day before polls are opened. Will the Chancellor of Germany following the next election be from the CDU/CSU union? yes.",
            ". CDU - the Christian Democratic Union of Germany is the major party of the center-right in German politics: The CDU has headed the federal government since 2005 under Angela Merkel, who also served as the party's leader from 2000 until 2018. The CDU previously led the federal government from 1949 to 1969 and 1982 to 1998. Germany's three longest-serving post-war Chancellors have all come from the CDU; Helmut Kohl , Angela Merkel , and Konrad Adenauer . The party also leads the governments of six of Germany's sixteen states. --CDU, wikipedia CDU currently forms a coalition government with CSU , and SPD . CDU and CSU hold an agreement that CDU does not run candidates in Bavaria, while CSU does not run candidates anywhere besides Bavaria. In forming this alliance, it is not unlikely that CSU may appoint the next chancellor following the elections, even if they win fewer seats than CDU. The 2021 German federal election is expected to be held on 2021-09-26, the date chosen by President Steinmeier. However, there is still a possibility of the snap election at an earlier date. As of the moment of writing this question, the CDU/CSU union steadily leads in election polls. In Vox's Future Perfect series, Dylan Matthews forecasted an 80% chance that CDU will continue to govern Germany throughout 2021. Will the Chancellor of Germany following the next election be from the CDU/CSU union? This question resolves positive if the Chancellor of Germany is from the CDU or CSU when they are elected after the next Bundestag Election. If they are a member of any other party, the question resolves negative. The election need not happen on 2021-09-26 nor must the chancellor be elected immediately. In the case there is an acting government while parties negotiate to form a formal government, this question will wait to resolve until a new government is formed. In the case an election is scheduled earlier, the question will close 1 day before polls are opened. Will the Chancellor of Germany following the next election be from the CDU/CSU union? no."

The combination of rules means that a general election for Australian Federal Parliament will almost certainly be held between Saturday 7 August 2021 and Saturday 21 May 2022. Will an Australian Federal Election be held in 2021? This question resolves positively iff an election is held for the Australian House of Representatives in 2021. This election need not also include the Australian Senate, nor will an election for only the Senate qualify. If the Australian Electoral Commission website gives an announcement for the date of the next election, the question will close retroactively to the day before the announcement. Fine print Will an Australian Federal Election be held in 2021? no."

On December 8th 2020, Starship SN8 was the first SpaceX Starship prototype to fly to a height of at least 1 km. On Feburary 2nd 2021, Starship SN9 was the second prototype to do so. Both SN8 and SN9 failed to land successfully, exploding on impact. The cause of SN8's failure is thought to be fuel tank underpressure, causing oxygen-rich combustion to overheat and destroy one engine. The cause of SN9's failure was that one of the two Raptor engines used for the attempted landing failed to re-light for the landing burn. When asked why SN9 did not re-light all three engines, and subsequently shut-off one of them if all three re-lit successfully, Elon Musk responded that It was foolish of us not to start 3 engines & immediately shut down 1, as 2 are needed to land. The Starship SN10 prototype is currently on the launch pad being fitted with Raptor engines, and is expected to fly soon. Will SpaceX's SN10 Starship prototype vehicle land successfully?

Wade; 3 other states go farther to guarantee the absolute right to abortion. 22 states have laws passed which are more restrictive than Roe allows; they are for now, but some predict that the current Supreme Court may overturn Roe, or carve smaller exceptions to Roe. In such a case, one of these \"trigger\" laws currently on the books could then take effect immediately. Kelsey Piper of Vox predicted this has a 40% of happening: The Supreme Court, now dominated by justices who think Roe v. Wade was wrongly decided, might overturn it in the next year. More likely, they might technically leave it in place but hollow it out. I consider it pretty likely that they'll aim to reduce abortion access only a little, and that they won't overturn Roe or take any larger steps to allow states to pass sweeping abortion bans. [...] In the long run, I expect very few US states to stand by such total bans \u2014 they're overwhelmingly unpopular with the American public, most of whom want abortion available at least under limited circumstances, especially early in a pregnancy. But they've made their way onto the books, protected from public scrutiny by the fact that they're currently and if the Supreme Court lets them go into effect, millions of Americans will temporarily live under deeply unpopular, extreme anti-abortion laws. I consider this somewhat unlikely \u2014 the Supreme Court tends to prefer not to take such strong steps when it can instead advance its aims more gradually by chipping away, rather than overturning, Roe \u2014 but still likely enough that it ought to be on everyone's radar. By 2022, Will at least one abortion ban currently blocked by federal courts go into effect? This question will resolve positively if any of 19 state-level abortion bans become enforcable by ruling of a federal court in 2021. An elligble law will qualify if it is enforcable without amendment or modification for any length of time during 2021; it need not be actually enforced in reality.

Universal Basic Income is a proposal to give unrestricted cash transfers to everyone in a given population . Proponents argue that UBI could end poverty, support people in a technological unemployment crisis, or could reform existing social welfare systems. Critics argue that UBI could be prohibitively expensive, disincentivize people from pursing productive work, or even argue that work is an intrinsic good. UBI has been studied, in some limited circumstances. The State of Alaska provides a stipend to its citizens , and many studies have been run on sampled populations, like those run by GiveDirectly. In Vox's Future Perfect, Sigal Samuel predicts: At least three new basic income pilots will be launched [...] I think basic income will continue to gain momentum in 2021, with at least three new pilots launching globally.

Related question by @Fee, with many background facts: Troops in Afghanistan on 2021-05-01 In the late 20th century, the United States provided assistance to a group of Afghanis known then as mujahedeen, who were trying to evict a Soviet occupation force. Some non-Afghanis gravitated to Afghanistan to help the mujahedeen. To coordinate these outsiders, a new organization was formed; its name was Al Qaeda. One of the outsiders, a Saudi engineer named Usama bin Laden , became the network's leader; he & al Qaeda were welcomed to establish a base of operations in Afghanistan after the Soviets left. On September 11, 2001, in an event commonly referred to as 9/11, four terrorist cells totalling 19 men executed a mission for which they had been trained by al Qaeda in Afghanistan. The mission caused significant loss of life in Arlington County, Virginia, NY County, New York, and Somerset County, Pennsylvania, as well as large-scale property damage in those locales. Soon after that, on October 7, 2001, the United States began overt military operations in Afghanistan. Those operations expanded to other Asian nations during a 19-year military presence. On May 2, 2011, the U. S. Navy's \"Seal Team Six\" carried out a secret mission in Pakistan during which they killed Usama bin Laden. U. S.forces remained in Afghanistan.. Following various \"troop drawdowns\", the U. S.agreed to leave that country before the 10th anniversary of bin Laden's death; but President Biden decided that some troops would remain there until the 20th anniversary of the al Qaeda attacks on civilians in the eastern U. S.. Such timetables are sometimes delayed by factors foreseeable & unforeseeable. This question asks: Will U. S.military troops be in Afghanistan on 2021-10-7? Statements issued by civilian leaders of the U. S.military, or by any member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, will be deemed credible unless contradicted by very persuasive statements from any source familiar with the territory. Resolution of this question will not be affected by the presence in Afghanistan of Red Cross, \"blue hats\", or any Private military contractors or \"PMCs\". Similarly, troops guarding the US diplomatic presence and unreported special forces missions will not be counted. 2021-10-7 refers to October 7, 2021.

Can't speak for regulators though.\" Tesla did release earlier this year the beta for what they call Full Self-Driving Capability, which suggests an improvement on the driver assistance system, presumably with less driver input, or even none as Elon Musk suggests in his tweet. However, Elon Musk is known to make bold statements about the capabilities of the cars his company produces, sometimes bordering on bad faith. According to Business Insider, in 2015, he predicted that the company's fully autonomous vehicles would be ready by 2018. In 2016, he said a Tesla would drive itself coast to coast the following year. In early 2019, Musk said he was certain that a Tesla \"will be able to find you in a parking lot, pick you up, take you all the way to your destination without an intervention - this year.\" Will a Tesla car demonstrate fully autonomous capability before the end of 2021? For the definition of fully autonomous cars, we'll be referencing the \"self driving level 5\", as defined by the SAE International: \"the vehicle performs all driving tasks under all conditions. Zero human attention or interaction is required.\" We will allow cars that need human override in extreme circumstances, but we expect less than one override per car in a typical year. Besides being autonomous, the vehicle will have to perform as well as a normal car with an average driver. Elon Musk raised valid concerns about the regulatory environment, which might cause a delay in the adoption of the technology. I believe however that, in the case of a successful development of the required software updates and/or new prototypes, Tesla will provide enough information to the press to allow for the publication of unequivocal articles referencing explicitly the tested unit's compliance with \"self driving level 5\" requirements as defined by the SAE International.

The U. S. CDC currently defines three classes of SARS-CoV-2 variants. For our purposes, variants of concern and variants of high consequence are of particular interest: Variant of concern : \"variant for which there is evidence of an increase in more severe disease , significant reduction in neutralization by antibodies generated during previous infection or vaccination, reduced effectiveness of treatments or vaccines, or diagnostic detection failures.\" As of the most recent CDC update on 27 April, there are five VOCs: B.1.1.7, P.1, B.1.351, B.1.427, and B.1.429. Variant of high consequence : \"variant of high consequence has clear evidence that prevention measures or medical countermeasures have significantly reduced effectiveness relative to previously circulating variants.\" As of the most recent CDC update on 27 April, there are no VOHCs. Of the five variants categorized under these categories , as of 27 April 2021 there are four that cause \"reduced neutralization by convalescent and sera\" : P.1, B.1.351, B.1.427, and B.1.429.

This question will resolve on the basis of the most recent update of the \"Unweighted Proportions of Variants of Concern and Other Lineages by State or Jurisdiction\" table on the U. S.

The UVA Biocomplexity Institute has been providing modeling and advanced analytics for the Commonwealth of Virginia, including projections and a slide deck with with data and results, updated weekly. This includes assigning a case trajectory to each of Virginia's 35 Local Health Districts . LHDs are administrative units and range in scale from individual cities to groups of several counties. Trajectories indicate the direction and speed of case rate change rather than incidence level. Trajectories are: Declining: Sustained decreases following a recent peak Plateau: Steady level with minimal trend up or down. Slow Growth: Sustained growth not rapid enough to be considered a Surge In Surge: Currently experiencing sustained rapid and significant growth.

The question resolves ambiguously if the UVA Biocomplexity stops publishing district trajectories, or eliminates the \"Declining\" or \"Plateau\" categories prior to a \"Yes\" resolution. However, changes in method or criteria do not affect resolution.

Trajectories resolve based on the slide decks posted on the Virginia Department of Health's COVID-19 Data Insights Blog. The question resolves ambiguously if the UVA Biocomplexity stops publishing district trajectories, or eliminates the \"Declining\" or \"Plateau\" categories prior to a \"Yes\" resolution. However, changes in method or criteria do not affect resolution. Surge trajectories are also published on the UVA Biocomplexity Institute's COVID-19 Pandemic Response page and in the UVA COVID-19 Model Dashboard. However, these are preliminary and do not affect resolution. The Virginia Department of Health reports weekly case data by health district. Population data is based on the latest Vintage Bridged-Race Postcensal Population Estimates. . 19 July 2021 clarification: A 3 consecutive week period here means there must be a single three-week period in which all health districts are in decline or plateau or have less than 5 cases per 100k. Will all local health districts in Virginia either be in declining or plateau trajectories OR report fewer than 5 cases per 100k residents per week for 3 consecutive weeks prior to 1 September 2021? no."

Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, born 19 June 1964, is a British politician and writer serving as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and Leader of the Conservative Party since July 2019. Johnson is considered a divisive or controversial figure in UK politics.

Conversely, his critics have accused him of elitism, cronyism, and prejudice. His actions that are viewed by supporters as pragmatic tend to be viewed by opponents as opportunistic. As of April 2021, Johnson is the subject of a controversy concerning renovation of his official residence in Downing Street, and the British Electoral Commission is to investigate the affair. The spending watchdog said there were \"reasonable grounds to suspect that an offence or offences may have occurred\".

The city is based on a concept by American economist Paul Romer and is intended to form a city-state with private government and its own fiscal, regulatory, and legal architecture. The city is being developed in a previously unoccupied 58 acre area that has been carved out of Honduras under a legal arrangement called ZEDE . Under this regulation, other parts of Honduras could be annexed to Pr\u00f3spera in the future as long as the owners of the land are willing to sell it to the city. This land need not be contiguous with the current tract, which could turn Pr\u00f3spera into a network of exclaves within Honduras. The city currently contains only three buildings and has no permanent population. The project seeks to attract both Hondurans escaping poverty and violence and highly mobile international professionals with a package of pro-market, libertarian policies.

            ". Elizabeth Holmes and Ramesh \"Sunny\" Balwani are charged with two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and nine counts of wire fraud. According to the indictment, the charges stem from allegations that Holmes and Balwani engaged in a scheme to defraud investors, and a separate scheme to defraud doctors and patients. Both schemes involved efforts to promote Theranos, a company founded by Holmes and based in Palo Alto, California. Theranos was a private health care and life sciences company with the stated mission to revolutionize medical laboratory testing through allegedly innovative methods for drawing blood, testing blood, and interpreting the resulting patient data. Holmes and Balwani used advertisements and solicitations to encourage and induce doctors and patients to use Theranos's blood testing laboratory services, even though, according to the government, the defendants knew Theranos was not capable of consistently producing accurate and reliable results for certain blood tests. It is further alleged that the tests performed on Theranos technology were likely to contain inaccurate and unreliable results. Holmes denies the charges and is presumed to be innocent. Theranos raised more than $700 million from venture capitalists and private investors, resulting in a $10 billion valuation at its peak in 2013 and 2014. By 2015, Forbes had named Holmes the youngest and wealthiest self-made female billionaire in America. A turning point came later in 2015 when medical research professors John Ioannidis and Eleftherios Diamandis, along with investigative journalist John Carreyrou of The Wall Street Journal, questioned the validity of Theranos' technology. The company faced a string of legal and commercial challenges from medical authorities, investors, the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, state attorneys general, former business partners, patients, and others. By June 2016, it was estimated that Holmes' personal net worth had dropped from $4.5 billion to virtually nothing. After efforts to find a buyer went nowhere, what remained of the company dissolved on September 4, 2018. Holmes is currently awaiting trial. The jury selection process will begin soon, subject to further legal wrangling, with the trial expected to commence on August 31. However, the trial has been delayed a number of times, and it may be delayed again. According to a jury questionnaire proposed by Holmes' lawyers, the trial is expected to last 13 weeks, or possibly longer. Will Elizabeth Holmes be convicted on fraud charges related to Theranos before 2023? This question resolves positively if before 1 January 2023, Elizabeth Holmes is convicted of any charge of fraud, or conspiracy to commit fraud, in connection with Theranos. A conviction on any other charges will not count towards resolution. If Holmes is not convicted on fraud charges connected to Theranos before 1 January 2023, this question resolves negatively. If Holmes' trial ends without a verdict, that will not automatically cause negative resolution, as it is possible that Holmes could be convicted in a subsequent retrial before 1 January 2023. If this question is still open on the date that a verdict is rendered, a plea leading to conviction is entered, or the charges against Holmes are dismissed, the question should resolve retroactively to the time and date such an event is announced by the court, or by representatives of two opposing parties to the case.

By June 2016, it was estimated that Holmes' personal net worth had dropped from $4.5 billion to virtually nothing. After efforts to find a buyer went nowhere, what remained of the company dissolved on September 4, 2018. Holmes is currently awaiting trial. The jury selection process will begin soon, subject to further legal wrangling, with the trial expected to commence on August 31. However, the trial has been delayed a number of times, and it may be delayed again. According to a jury questionnaire proposed by Holmes' lawyers, the trial is expected to last 13 weeks, or possibly longer. Will Elizabeth Holmes be convicted on fraud charges related to Theranos before 2023? This question resolves positively if before 1 January 2023, Elizabeth Holmes is convicted of any charge of fraud, or conspiracy to commit fraud, in connection with Theranos. A conviction on any other charges will not count towards resolution. If Holmes is not convicted on fraud charges connected to Theranos before 1 January 2023, this question resolves negatively. If Holmes' trial ends without a verdict, that will not automatically cause negative resolution, as it is possible that Holmes could be convicted in a subsequent retrial before 1 January 2023. If this question is still open on the date that a verdict is rendered, a plea leading to conviction is entered, or the charges against Holmes are dismissed, the question should resolve retroactively to the time and date such an event is announced by the court, or by representatives of two opposing parties to the case. Will Elizabeth Holmes be convicted on fraud charges related to Theranos before 2023? no."

It had been expected that NASA would issue two awards, due to its previous statements that competition and redundancy were \"extremely important principles\" for the program, and so only having one was widely seen as surprising. In its source selection statement [pdf], NASA stressed that the selection of a single provider was due entirely to the fact that the HLS program was underfunded, to the point where they could only award the cheapest bid from SpaceX after negotiating with them to change the funding schedule. Later information releases revealed that SpaceX had bid $2.9B, Blue Origin $5.9B, and Dynetics approximately $8.5B. There have been several developments since then which have raised the possibility of NASA revisiting this contract and awarding two providers as it had originally planned: Blue Origin and Dynetics quickly filed protests on what they claim to be an unfair award selection, and NASA issued a stop-work order to SpaceX until the Government Accountability Office reviewed the protests. The GAO denied these protest on July 30, saying that NASA acted legally in awarding only a single company. The version of S. 1260 The U. S. Innovation and Competitiveness Act which the Senate passed on June 8 includes in it language which directs NASA to select a second HLS provider, while protecting SpaceX's current award. It would have to do this within 60 days from the current list of bids, which means either Blue Origin or Dynetics would be selected. However, this directive is an authorization, not an appropriation, meaning that it does not provide funding for this mandate. Additionally, it appears that there may be some resistance to this in the House, and the bill's ultimate future is unknown. NASA Administrator Bill Nelson is pushing to fund HLS with a total of $10B through the \"infrastructure bill\" which Congress is currently debating.

NASA Administrator Bill Nelson is pushing to fund HLS with a total of $10B through the \"infrastructure bill\" which Congress is currently debating. On July 26, Jeff Bezos offered to waive the first $2 billion in costs if NASA chose Blue Origin as a second HLS lander system. Will NASA issue a second fully-funded award for its Human Landing System contract before 2022? This question will resolve positively if before 1 January 2022, NASA awards a fully funded second HLS contract to a provider other than SpaceX. This question will resolve negatively otherwise. Fine print Will NASA issue a second fully-funded award for its Human Landing System contract before 2022? no."

Specifically, we find that the Governor sexually harassed a number of current and former New York State employees by, among other things, engaging in unwelcome and nonconsensual touching, as well as making numerous offensive comments of a suggestive and sexual nature that created a hostile work environment for women. Our investigation revealed that the Governor's sexually harassing behavior was not limited to members of his own staff, but extended to other State employees, including a State Trooper on his protective detail and members of the public. We also conclude that the Executive Chamber's culture\u2014one filled with fear and intimidation, while at the same time normalizing the Governor's frequent flirtations and gender-based to the conditions that allowed the sexual harassment to occur and persist. That culture also influenced the improper and inadequate ways in which the Executive Chamber has responded to allegations of harassment. Following the release of the report, multiple prominent Democrats called on Cuomo to resign, but at a press conference on 3 August Cuomo appeared to decline to resign.

This is a major concern as the amount of objects in Earth's orbit and the complexity of space traffic management increase. Union of Concerned Scientists Space Debris Fact Sheet For example, a January 2007 kinetic ASAT test conducted by China on a non-operational weather satellite created over 3,000 pieces of space debris. 2007 Chinese Anti-Satellite Test Fact Sheet, Secure World Foundation India's 2019 Mission Shakti is another example. See, e.g. \"NASA Says Debris From India's Antisatellite Test Puts Space Station at Risk\". As both the militarization and the of space continue, the effects of space ASAT tests have become a source of concern for the international community. This question asks whether an ASAT test by any state actor will create more than one piece of space debris between the launch of this question and the question closing date, as reported by credible news sources or research institutes. Will a state actor conduct an ASAT test that results in space debris between the launch of this question and January 1, 2023? This question will resolve positively if a mainstream news source or wire service or a credible non-profit organization or research center concludes that an ASAT test conducted by a state actor resulted in more than one piece of space debris between 2021-08-06 and 2023-01-01.

The resolution of this question is meant to support or undermine his preferred theory. Read the essay to learn more about how this question applies to the 'Government Debt Theory' of inflation. The CPI, or Consumer Price Index, is one of the most widely used measures of inflation by investors. Created by analyzing the price of a certain basket of widely used, urban consumer goods over time with relation to a base time, the CPI can show either monthly or yearly price fluctuations. The CPI for specific cities, types of goods, and by wage-earners can also be calculated. One approach for extracting the trend in inflation from short-term fluctuations in the CPI is to weight the food and energy components at zero on the grounds that volatility in these components can be misleading. The result is the \"core CPI,\" which this forecast question uses, and which is released monthly by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics Commercial paper is a type of security issued by large corporations to obtain funds to meet short-term debt obligations. Their real interest rate can be calculated by subtracting the CPI inflation rate from their nominal interest rate.

One approach for extracting the trend in inflation from short-term fluctuations in the CPI is to weight the food and energy components at zero on the grounds that volatility in these components can be misleading. The result is the \"core CPI,\" which this forecast question uses, and which is released monthly by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics Commercial paper is a type of security issued by large corporations to obtain funds to meet short-term debt obligations. Their real interest rate can be calculated by subtracting the CPI inflation rate from their nominal interest rate. In 2022, for any month where US core CPI inflation is more than 3 percent , will inflation be at most 3 percentage points higher than the three-month commercial paper interest rate? This question resolves ambiguous if there is no month in 2022 where core CPI inflation is above 3%. This resolves positive if there is at least one month in 2022 where core CPI inflation is above 3%, and also for all such months, inflation is at most 3 percentage points higher than the 3-month prime commercial paper interest rate. This resolves negative if there is at least one month in 2022 where core CPI inflation is above 3%, and for any such month, inflation is more than 3 percentage points higher than the 3-month prime commercial paper interest rate. In 2022, for any month where US core CPI inflation is more than 3 percent (here, annualized inflation), will inflation be at most 3 percentage points higher than the three-month commercial paper interest rate? no."

Few experts consider that likely to happen, but if it did, it could trigger an economic catastrophe with effects far beyond America's shores. In a letter to members of Congress last week, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned of the damage that would result if the U. S.is unable, even for a short time, to pay its bills. \"A delay that calls into question the federal government's ability to meet all its obligations would likely cause irreparable damage to the U. S.economy and global financial markets,\" wrote Yellen, the former chair of the Federal Reserve Board. \"At a time when American families, communities, and businesses are still suffering from the effects of the ongoing global pandemic, it would be particularly irresponsible to put the full faith and credit of the United States at risk.\" With that crisis looming, Democrats and Republicans in Washington are battling over who should take responsibility for the politically unpopular task of raising the cap on borrowing, commonly known as the debt limit. Republicans, led by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, have vowed that not a single one of them will vote to raise the limit. As of September 20th, Business Insider reports that Mitch McConnell says the GOP will vote for the US to default on its debt: \"We will not support legislation that raises the debt limit,\" McConnell said after Pelosi and Schumer's announcement. \"Democrats do not need our help.\" It is currently unclear when exactly the US would become unable to meet its obligations; Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said only that the Treasury will run out of cash \"sometime in October.\" Will the U.

This resolves positive if, before Jan. 1, 2022, an announcement is made in any statement following the almost-monthly meetings of the FOMC, that the pace of bond purchases will be lowered at some point in the future. All the previous statements and the calendars for future meetings this year are here, and any future statements will also be available in the same place. Will the Fed announce a slow-down in bond purchases from the current $120 billion per month before Jan. 1, 2022? no."

            ". This is one of several questions in this tournament focused on nuclear proliferation, force sizes, or yields. See here for a list of such questions and some discussion of these topics. According to a BBC article released on 19-10-2021: \"North Korea has carried out a flurry of missile tests in recent weeks, including of what it said were hypersonic and long-range weapons. Some of these tests violate strict international sanctions. The country is specifically prohibited by the United Nations from testing ballistic missiles as well as nuclear weapons. The UN considers ballistic missiles to be more threatening than cruise missiles because they can carry more powerful payloads, have a longer range and can fly faster.\" See also a list of North Korean missile tests. Will North Korea launch another ballistic missile before 2024? This question will resolve positively if a missile with a range of more than 5,500 km, capable of hosting a nuclear warhead, is launched by the North Korean government. Resolution is by credible media report, with assessment provided by US or UK government, or by a statement of confirmation that this has happened given by any permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. Note that: The missile does not have to be launched successfully for a positive resolution; any confirmed launch will suffice Either a test launch or a launch as part of an attack could count toward positive resolution For positive resolution, the missile does not have to actually be hosting a nuclear warhead when launched, as long as it is capable of hosting a nuclear warhead See also: *Will there be at least one fatality from an offensive nuclear detonation in North Korea by 2050, if there's an offensive detonation anywhere? Will North Korea launch another ballistic missile before 2024? yes.",
            ". This is one of several questions in this tournament focused on nuclear proliferation, force sizes, or yields. See here for a list of such questions and some discussion of these topics. According to a BBC article released on 19-10-2021: \"North Korea has carried out a flurry of missile tests in recent weeks, including of what it said were hypersonic and long-range weapons. Some of these tests violate strict international sanctions. The country is specifically prohibited by the United Nations from testing ballistic missiles as well as nuclear weapons. The UN considers ballistic missiles to be more threatening than cruise missiles because they can carry more powerful payloads, have a longer range and can fly faster.\" See also a list of North Korean missile tests.

On August 25, 2020, amid the unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin after the police shooting of Jacob Blake, Kyle Rittenhouse, a 17-year-old from Antioch, Illinois, shot and killed two men and wounded another man in the arm during confrontations at two locations. Rittenhouse was subsequently charged with multiple felonies in connection with these events, and is currently on trial. Rittenhouse is presumed innocent until proven guilty, and has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges. Rittenhouse is charged with two counts of first-degree intentional homicide, one count of attempted first-degree homicide, two counts of first-degree recklessly endangering safety, and one misdemeanour count of possession of a dangerous weapon by a person under age 18. This misdemeanour charge is not relevant to this question, but is mentioned here for completeness.

This question resolves positively if before 1 January 2022, Rittenhouse is convicted on any of the previously enumerated felony charges against him. These are the two counts of first-degree intentional homicide, the single count of attempted first-degree homicide, and the two counts of first-degree recklessly endangering safety. A conviction on any other charges, felony or misdemeanour, is irrelevant to the resolution of this question. The question will resolve negatively if this does not happen, including if there is a mistrial and any subsequent retrial on these charges does not result in a conviction on at least one of the felony charges before January 1, 2022. This question closes retroactively to the moment the jury are instructed to deliberate on any felony charge in this case, or the moment the jury is directed to deliver a particular verdict on any felony charge, or the moment all felony charges are dismissed, or the moment any plea on a felony charge is changed to guilty, whichever happens earlier. Note that this question is strictly a prediction as to what will happen, and not a statement or assertion in relation to Rittenhouse's actual guilt or innocence.

This question resolves positively if, between December 11, 2021 and January 1, 2023, representatives of the Government of the Russian Federation announce or acknowledge that Russia has invaded Ukraine, or if any two Permanent Members of the United Nations Security Council announce or acknowledge that the Russian Federation has invaded Ukraine. These announcements must be describing events which took place during the same period, from December 11, 2021 to January 1, 2023. Areas of Ukraine already occupied by Russia as of December 11, 2021, will not trigger resolution. Will Russia invade Ukrainian territory before 2023? no."

ELK is currently unsolved in the worst case\u2014for every training strategy we've thought of so far, we can describe a case where an ML model trained with that strategy would give unambiguously bad answers to straightforward questions despite knowing better. Situations like this may or may not come up in practice, but nonetheless we are interested in finding a strategy for ELK for which we can't think of any counterexample. ELK and the existing counterexamples are described in more detail in ARC's December 2021 report Eliciting latent knowledge: How to tell if your eyes deceive you. Here is how the post describes prize awards: To win a prize, you need to specify a training strategy for ELK that handles all of the counterexamples that we've described so far, summarized in the section below\u2014i.e.where the breaker would need to specify something new about the test case to cause the strategy to break down. You don't need to fully solve the problem in the worst case to win a prize, you just need to come up with a strategy that requires a new counterexample. We'll give a $5,000 prize to any proposal that we think clears this bar. We'll give a $50,000 prize to a proposal which we haven't considered and seems sufficiently promising to us or requires a new idea to break. We'll give intermediate prizes for ideas that we think are promising but we've already considered, as well as for proposals that come with novel clarify some other aspect of the problem, or are interesting in other ways. A major purpose of the contest is to provide support for people understanding the problem well enough to start contributing; we aren't trying to only reward ideas that are new to us. Some retroactive prizes have already been awarded as described below: We're giving prizes to existing proposals from David Dalrymple , Ramana Kumar , John Maxwell , and Yonadav Shavit .

However, a large population of wolves remained in Canada. In 1973, the gray wolf was added to the list of species protected by the Endangered Species Act . This protection rendered wolf hunting illegal and mandated that recovery plans be made for the species. Over the next half century, wolf populations in the contiguous United States recovered thanks to natural migration and intentional reintroductions by wildlife agencies.

Management of wolf populations was returned to the state agencies, and some states swiftly reestablished hunting programs, which have resulted in the reduction of local wolf populations.

            ". Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the United States has issued a number of economic sanctions against top Russian officials and on Russian trade, focusing primarily on cutting off Russian financial institutions and access to global capital. However, the US has yet to target one of Russia's most key industries, their petro-energy sector. The US currently relies heavily on Russian gas and oil imports: In 2021, Russia accounted for 21% of all U. S.gasoline imports, with Canada second at 17%. By value, Russian imports increased 71.05%, which is slightly less than gasoline imports from the world, which increased 80.53%. The Russian total was $12.78 billion. An anonymous senior official at the White House told Politico on Feb 24, 2022 that: \"'no option is off the table,' but 'starting out with energy could actually benefit Putin and pad his pockets. Given high oil and gas prices, cutting off Russian oil and gas will drive prices up to Putin's benefit. And as we have said repeatedly on the record, on background [and] off the record, our sanctions are designed to harm Russia's economy, not ours.'\" This question explores whether the US will reverse its decision to avoid sanctioning Russian oil and gas imports. Will the US sanction Russian oil or gas before 2023? This question will resolve as the date when the United States sanctions on Russian oil or gas go into effect, in any form. These sanctions may be on the government of Russia or a Russian company, and do not need to apply to 100% of oil & gas products. Resolution will be provided through at least three reputable news reports or an official announcement from the White House. Will the US sanction Russian oil or gas before 2023? yes.",

In the 2022 Russian Invasion of Ukraine, Belarus, ally of Russia, has allowed Russian troops in Belarussian territory to conduct operations on the Ukranian border, but Belarus has not yet deployed its own forces in the conflict. In March 2022, Ukranian officials accused Russia of firing on Belarus from Ukranian territory to create a pretext for a Belarussian invasion. On March 4, Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko said the Belarusian armed forces were not taking part and would not take part in Russia's military operation in Ukraine. Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who ran in an election opposing Lukashenko in 2020, spoke to Fox News on March 23, 2022, saying \"We are receiving information about a possible invasion of Ukraine by the forces of Belarus\". Will Belarus invade Ukraine before June 1, 2022? This question will resolve as \"Yes\" If, at any time between February 1, 2022 and June 1, 2022, either any 2 Permanent members of the UN security council or official representatives of Russia or Belarus officially state that Belarussian armed forces have invaded Ukraine. For the purposes of this question, \"Ukranian territory\" will be defined as Ukraine's internationally recognized borders as of January 1, 2014. The declaration of a Belarussian invasion must be referring at least in part to events which occurred between February 1, 2022 to June 1, 2022. If no such declaration occurs by June 1, 2022, 00:00 UTC, this question will resolve as \"No\". Will Belarus invade Ukraine before June 1, 2022? yes.",

They now say both sides have agreed to a full two-month ceasefire, beginning the first full day of Ramadan. This will be the first nationwide truce in Yemen in years, a welcome respite for its war-weary population. The death toll of the war in Yemen is estimated to have been 377,000 at the end of 2021, according to a report from the UN's Development Programme. The majority of the deaths are among children under the age of five, the report says, with one child dying every nine minutes according to the UNDP. The war, which is in its seventh year, has seen some 80 percent of the population, or 24 million people, relying on aid and assistance, including 14.3 million who are in acute need. With Yemen importing more than 35% of its wheat from Russia and Ukraine, the disruption to wheat supplies will cause soaring increases in the price of food. UN officials say the truce could be easily extended. The UN started with a ceasefire meant for just the month of Ramadan, but the Houthis were resisting when it didn't include any easing of the naval blockade. Exact terms aren't public yet, but the UN press release states that the blockade will indeed be eased some. Fuel shipments to Hudaydah ports will be permitted, and certain flights in and out of Sana'a will also be allowed. The two sides are also discussing a prisoner swap under which hundreds from both sides would be freed. Ceasefires don't always hold as hoped, but if this one does, it could be the start of a proper peace process. Credit: this background is adapted from this article here and this article here.

In previous waves of covid, the strategy of mass testing and quarantining positive cases, along with partial lockdowns and border measures, was able to outpace the spread of the virus.

Despite the financial hub's two-stage lockdown\u2014now extended covid cases shot up from double digits in early March to over 20,000 on Tuesday . Nevertheless, the consensus seems to be that China won't relax its prevention tactics until 2023, because of a key political event that will take place in October or November. At this year's Communist Party Congress, which takes place every five years, Chinese leader Xi Jinping is expected to announce his third term.

A generic person who tests positive in China for COVID-19 is no longer legally required to self-isolate for any amount of time, after testing positive. There is at least one city in mainland China with a population of more than one million people which recorded at least 10,000 COVID-19 cases in the past 7 days, and is not currently imposing any lockdown over a significant fraction of its residents. A lockdown is defined as any policy of major restrictions on ordinary travel, or restrictions on social gatherings. If before June 1st 2022, China has abandoned their zero-covid strategy, this question resolves positively. Otherwise, it resolves negatively. Will China abandon their zero-covid strategy before June 1, 2022? no."
